  Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.
  Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.
  Not the same, but related.
  One is about structure, one is about execution.
  Concurrency provides a way to structure a solution
  to solve a problem that may (but not necessarily) be parallelizable.

HazeAnderson: I read someone explaining that Java is essentially a language with no verbs, only nouns (and the VERY end there is a verb but you can't see it)
