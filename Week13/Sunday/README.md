vexedkiller0071: Okay legitimate programming question can you put an r string
inside of an f string?

f"{r''}"
r""

elementalwarrior: Mocking acts really strangely. You need to mock the function
call in the calling file OR you do an import and change the function on the
imported module object (not a from statement)
