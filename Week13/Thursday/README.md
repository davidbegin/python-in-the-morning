Problems on the horizon:

- Satoshios back
- Steem Split is troubling

Begin is stressed about a revolution:

!arch
!linux
!dropeffect dgksk8lif
!wtf
!teachme

- We must support community, and we have to avoid reward people giving
  money to one person.
- One individual is given all the money, and they just run amock
- The Goverment is going to support community efforts, that encourage,
  not giving money to one person

## Goals / Ideas

- Community Triggered Events
  - IASIP and curb to start
- Improve Our Breaking News Interface
  - Tests
  - Easier to Add New Breaking News Events
- Adpocalypse
  - People should be able to submit Ads, for them to earn cool points

## Feature Idea

- if you don't supply command name, it becomes your theme song
  - We just need to hook up the trig{}

## Adpocalypse

Where will Ads show

- Opening of Stream
  - Art Matt Dank, would be advertising what sounds he thinks people should buy
  - Stupac Have you tried Qtile AD -> With Proof of install you earn X rewards
    - Qtile Add with a one time coupon code, that if you type in chat, you get
      cool points
- BRB
- News Segment
- In Adbreaks (more expensive obviously)

- How will we download them?
  - Curl?

Why Ads???
Don't We hate Ads???
Are Ads inevitable??

## Bot Goals

- Fix any bugs from yesterdays refactor
- Clean up the Helper Bot Commands
  - !soundeffect returns nothing

## Vim/Bash/I3

- Build a Dmenu shortcut for listing all sound effects
- Better interface for dropping sounds for people
- Clean Up Twitch Commands File, with the power of vim and bash

## Feature

- Build System to stop Speedreading from user chat
- Start Saving Cube Requests

## Bugs

- When deleting the log file, and not restarting the bot, we don't find the new
  log file again
- Tests are looking in real Samples folder

## Vim File Clean Up

Delete all matching pattern

```vim
:g/profile/d
```

Delete all Blank Lines

```vim
:g/^$/d
:v/./d
```

- <https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Uniq_-_Removing_duplicate_lines>
- <https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Delete_all_lines_containing_a_pattern>

```vim
:sort u
```

## Workflow improvements

VIM: use `c` not `d

Run Black on a File: `<leader>bl`

Enabled OBS hotkeys everywhere using the Hyper Key (ErgoDox)

Twitch I3 Shortcuts

$mod+y = prizes
$mod+t = basic commands
$mod+i = list of users

Ergo Dox 2nd Layer

gaodiablo: OK i got a python question, id like to know if my project idea can be
completed only with python
gaodiablo: I want a minimalist display showing the price of a few cryptocurrencies
gaodiablo: so using an api to connect to binance or something
gaodiablo: to get a live feed of the prices
gaodiablo: thats all

Live -> do you mean the website updating in real time.
    lil JS

whoisjudy: Why creds and points reset?
It's 6 AM here
....by the end of the stream, when everyone has commands
Its chaotic, and hard to work

Every day is a new chance for you, to become the most
popular on stream.

## Learnings

## Ponderings

qwertimer: why use tmux when alacritty and kitty do terminal tiling
gpu accelrated Terminal

.........what are the terminal speed problems I would seeing???

!add_perms qwertimer i3
stupac62: Can't do pairing without tmux or screen, right?

I am ready to be sold alacritty, but I ain't shopping for new terminal emulator
So I need to be told....why I need a new terminal emulator

The vim meme annoys me a little,
Meme: its hard, comes from everyones first vim experience
Which often is forced on us and hostile (git commit)

Vim was my first editor, people don't suggest it as first
But its what excits ME about programming
finding vim early on, and command line, stuff was excited.

Vim's not Hard, Vim's Fun

Editors are an investment in time, they are a skill you have to build up slowly

### Amazon's Memo first Policy

- We are trying it here
- It is a more extreme BDD (not a value statement)

#### Personal

- I like it in concept

## Opinions

I prefer running tests, myself, in more focused groups
versus autotest runners

I never find auto-test runners to be saving time

People who work wtih me all know, I have unusual capitalization
Begin: I capitalize what I want when I want

## Debates

## Memories

twice, maybe 3 times, you could kayak and canoe in my neighbors

## Begin Tip

```vim
psql
\e
-> hottest command
```

## Confessions

I had a senior dev, pair with me when I was lowly junior.
Vim, and lil screen.

We went to pair, he said nah you need to start Tmux
Ok....I'll that after work
He said nah, we doing that now

Important Lesson: Sometimes its ok to pair/work on some workflow improvements at
work
