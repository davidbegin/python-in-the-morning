# 2020 - 5 - 22

## IASIP

You propose and theres a 2 minute timer
and if being support within that time, then its trigger

2 mins, 3 votes:

Whatever you are to stream:

- Needs to be interesting to you!

- Soundboard
- sushidragon -> Built a wacky sitcom, surreal show into the stream

---

Keyboard Switch in January:

I started streaming in January
Fluent Python
Drink the Python Koolaid

## Idea

Split the Streaming:

- Beginbotbot - Twitch Channel would become a 24/7 market place for all sounds
  and what not

- Whispers -> I don't like how they are secret

- Build out the news network, automate the anchor
- Ad system up
- Build a more robust market tracker

## Goals / Ideas

- Community Triggered Events
  - IASIP and curb to start
- Don't allow Command Costs to dip below 0
- Save Cube Bets
- Improve Our Breaking News Interface
  - Tests
  - Easier to Add New Breaking News Events
- Adpocalypse
  - People should be able to submit Ads, for them to earn cool points
- Cost Reduction Plan:
  - All sounds will have their price cut in half everyday.

## Bug

- Refactor/Rewrite Prize Dropper

## Feature Idea

- if you don't supply command name, it becomes your theme song
  - We just need to hook up the trig{}

## Adpocalypse

Where will Ads show

- Opening of Stream
  - Art Matt Dank, would be advertising what sounds he thinks people should buy
  - Stupac Have you tried Qtile AD -> With Proof of install you earn X rewards
    - Qtile Add with a one time coupon code, that if you type in chat, you get
      cool points
- BRB
- News Segment
- In Adbreaks (more expensive obviously)

- How will we download them?
  - Curl?

Why Ads???
Don't We hate Ads???
Are Ads inevitable??

## Why Begin Can't Sleep

Problems on the horizon:

- Satoshios back
- Steem Split is troubling

Begin is stressed about a revolution:

- We must support community, and we have to avoid reward people giving
  money to one person.
- One individual is given all the money, and they just run amock
- The Goverment is going to support community efforts, that encourage,
  not giving money to one person

## Bot Goals

- Fix any bugs from yesterdays refactor
- Clean up the Helper Bot Commands
  - !soundeffect returns nothing

## Vim/Bash/I3

- Build a Dmenu shortcut for listing all sound effects
- Better interface for dropping sounds for people
- Clean Up Twitch Commands File, with the power of vim and bash

## Feature

- Build System to stop Speedreading from user chat
- Start Saving Cube Requests

## Bugs

- When deleting the log file, and not restarting the bot, we don't find the new
  log file again
- Tests are looking in real Samples folder

stupac62: CHAT do yourself a favor and watch this [We Dem Arby's BoyZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrzOx_EQEBo)

- Diskbot theme, its a registered bot, and we have it filtered for themes
  - WE need to figure out regitered bots and their rights

## Vim File Clean Up

Delete all matching pattern

```vim
:g/profile/d

```

Delete all Blank Lines

```vim
:g/^$/d
:v/./d
```

## Workflow improvements

VIM: use `c` not `d

Run Black on a File: `<leader>bl`

Enabled OBS hotkeys everywhere using the Hyper Key (ErgoDox)

Twitch I3 Shortcuts

$mod+y = prizes
$mod+t = basic commands
$mod+i = list of users

Ergo Dox 2nd Layer

  unique related to tech

Morale Conundrum

You work, while unmotivated....and it then it becomes fun.

Warm Up

## Debates

gaddam: You'd have to ask the teachers whom failed me as to why I'm so far
behind :D can a teacher fail you

## Memories

## Begins Tip

Sometimes Future and Past Begin Collaborate

If I'm gonna go out drinking:

- Past Begin leaves healthy traps for Drunk Future
- Leave Water, Healthy Snack

I thought morning Begin was 1 person:

- 2 morning begins
- 2 phases
- Initial Morning Begin:
  - we hate him
  - he only lives for around 5-10 mins

## Confessions

I've never owned an Xbox

And all my friends got really into Halo
but I was working and never played

and then I was playing, I was sooo bad, they didn't want to play
My friend mark, came over let me borrow his Xbox
to train, I tried to train for one day, and I quit

## Python Interview

nomorequity: How would you assess python expertise?
nomorequity: Portfolio? Live coding exercise?

- Should we schedule an interview

- previous jobs
- github
- personal

- OR is this an interview

baldclap: YOu should break that down baldclap: Do they have blog posts, do they
have past expertise, do they work on open source projects, are they general devs
of focused, baldclap: do they play well with others

Completely imprecise, and personal
who had a bad day
who do you remind someone of

Whats a broad, not perfect question that someone is passionate.

Micro-services:

Begin has hiring problem:

I have a biases, towards high-energy loud mouths.
