## Speed Read Reward

- People vote for fail, or continue,
  once a percentage of people say fail,
  automatically stop the speedread and record the time

## Code Questions

I am writing Tests in "Router" classes.
These take commands, pair a parser, with some other code
to fulfill a command.

Integration Tests:

- We aren't irc message, we are making

## Refactoring

- Use the New BaseDbModels
  - Refactor to use the new model syntax everywhere

- Breaking News is a mess
  - New Richest User in Cool Points
  - Revolutions
  - New Most Expensive

!bets

- Split CommandRouter

## TODO

### News Story Feature

- More info for news stories
- Hook Up Coup to Stories
- More info about what happened

Scenarios:

- Richest User Cool Points
- Richest User Street Cred
- Most Expensive Command
- Coup

### Cube Times

- Save cube times

### Documentation

- More Docs and Explanations
  - Tutorial Doc
  - Revolution Doc
  - Main Doc

### Bot Rights and Restrictions

- Bot registration
- Bot per user, the entrance fee, is you have to build yourself

## Ideas

- Make a Way Revolutionaries can come up with new governments

## Musings

I deserve NOTHING
NO ONE OWES ME ANYTHING
I MUST IMPROVE

### Old Coding Religion Begin Used to Follow

- Every file 1 class
- Files no longer than 100 lines
- Super minimal interface (goal typically less than 5 public methods)

## Goals

## Bugs

## Feature

## Code TODO

Twitch Practice:

- filtering bot talk for the on screen chat
- I'm watch full screen that chat.
- Not the real chat.

## Advice

Name your kid MQTT

When you get stuck in programming, THEN STOP AND LEARN
When you go balc you'll see options

backbone.js
DevOps, SRE, Internal Tooling

Westcoast: SF, LA, PDX

## Opinion

When you contribute to open-source, that push and organiziation, constraints
pround releases and collaborating, thats the skill you can't learn in a course

yossi_spira: I fully agree, I learned so much from open-source contribution. It
teaches you workflow and teamwork

### The Struggle with Personal Projects (That no one cares about)

Once it gets hard, ya quit
You never have to collab, or comprismise
No time-sensitivity

- Collabing, Sharing, Use
- Time Sensitivity
- Goal, MVP, V1
yossi_spira: *Compromise *Sensitivity *Accountability

How are we gonna make this project NOT personal?

## Viewer Questions

plushmasta: beginbot how are you q ueuing those sounds ? this is probably a very
popular q uestion, if so Im sorry to bother

Chatter: !{soundeffect}
Saves the request TinyDB -> JSON Database
Another -> reading out chunks of Sounds and playing in the row

ribic2: What is your opinion on Vue?
beginbot: Avoids the frontend at all costs
          Vue: I liked it seemed simpler than React, little more structure?

Beginner: What does that mean

Don't be afraid of regexs, theres a bit of meme around them, being harder than
they are

arjunathefeared: hey Begin, curious how how often you find yourself using Regex
in your code?

Beginbot: Every job yes, but not everyday nah, every 3 months.

If you "master" (decent proficency) regular expressions, you will very popular
at times.

You have to learn them at sometime.

The basic takes an afternoon,
Brush up.

nmhungary: How did you hét your First it Jób?

- Freelance
- Subcontract
- Job, at a company

- What are all the companies in town you want to work for
  - Read about their stack, do some research into whats
    its like working there
- Join the community:
  - Meetups (Virtual Meetups)
  - Hackathon
  - Help Beginners get setup on X language
- 6 months
  - Meet a bunch of programmers
  - Meet people at different jobs
  - You'll get advice

zerostheory: What was your studying technique ? Like on a daily basis.

What I was looking for:

- Ruby
- Small code
- TDD

Skills I noticed companies listed, I don't have:

!wtf
!teachme
!dropeffect leonhart19
!pewpew
!me

- Git
- Postgres
- Soft Skills
  - Work with others on a project

Online learning, no bootcamp, no school 0.

- Build Projects of Size
- Marketing of yourself -> Blogging, Speaking at meetups
- Looking for Clients (2 days a week, client, not coding)

My first good programming, was because I was more a musican
than a programmer. I was hanging out in the community, I got
rejected for the job, like 4 months earlier.

!discord

Hack this stupid test, to and get the job

Provide value, meet people, join a community, people as you to join
there community.

Once you one job.

Begin Beginners Fears:

People care too much about starting, or first job salary.

2 Options:

- Company 1 - Bigger, more money, more structure
- Company 2 - Smaller, less money, less structure

Company 1:

- More money that 2 years, and they get really good at Jira
  and meetings. They are a pro, at lunch. They can survive
  a sprint with the best.

Company 2;

- No structure, means you get take on bigger projects,
  you get more real experience
  more opprotunity to fail

2 Years later you are lookign for jobs

## Stream Visions

## Learnings

arjunathefeared: it was just solving little problems in coding bat. suddenly i
was able to take the syntax i learned that seemed jumbled and started applying
it toward a GUI project. it was like suddenly i was seeing all of the options
available to me now that the syntax made sense.

## Ponderings

TDD -> Test Driven (Development) (More like Design)

If you really focus on creating, multiple layers of tests,
starting from an outer layer (Acceptance tests) and you
really, only make the tests pass with the bare minimum,
and let design evolve.

mathefischer: Reason of using zsh instead of bash?
Beginbot: need to ponder

youtube-dl --no-cache-dir -x --postprocessor-args "-ss 00:01" "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9iSnGRTw_0"

pinkflufflyllama: i3-gaps i3-wm
Beginbot: need to ponder

I remember, all of sudden feeling like, I could grab anything off a webiste
and pass it anywhere in an application, throw it in any database

## Experiences

## Coding Games

- Pair Programming, ping-pong, one writes the test, one writes the code.
- Switch acting roles, of being nefarious

## Debates

arjunathefeared: you're not missing anything. america sucks right now.
Parts of america suck

pmurphy76: But don't keep jumping from job to job in a short amount of time (6
mos to 3 years) as well since companies will look at it as a bad thing as well.

Begin 3 Years: used to think 1 year was fine, for 5 jobs in a row
Current Begin: 1 years are fine, but ya need a 2, or 3.

I would not worry about the perception of hopping from company to company
I would focus all, on finding a right fit.

dougthecoder: @crazytech44 My personal take is that the best programmers see
themselves as solving business / people problems, and so your most important
skill is communicating and understanding the problem from their POV.
beginbot: agree

Hard Skill for some to learn: When to program, when to just send an email.

Project Managers asking you to do X
You ask the problem
And you do Y
AND CHANGE THE WHOLE GAME

!github

## Confessions

I worked inside a call center for my company in Oakland,
my job was write software they were using
To green energy loans

Talk to your customers!!!!!!
Observe their behavior

## Quotes

dougthecoder: A programmer who can translate between business / technology for
people is worth their weight in gold LSD
people is worth their weight in LSD
people is worth their weight in antimatter
