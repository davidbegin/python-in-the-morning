NO ONE OWES ME ANYTHING
I MUST IMPROVE

### Old Coding Religion Begin Used to Follow

- Every file 1 class
- Files no longer than 100 lines
- Super minimal interface (goal typically less than 5 public methods)

Twitch Practice:

- filtering bot talk for the on screen chat
- I'm watch full screen that chat.
- Not the real chat.

## Advice

## Opinion

phaqui: I would say that the test is broken
We TDD, writing some tests first
We also moving around
I could be more stringingent, and finish the full test,
but, I'd rather do half

When you TDD, it's OK to delete tests!
TDD helps influence design, that influence, doesn't

## Viewer Questions

vexedkiller0071: Okay legitimate programming question can you put an r string
inside of an f string?

f"{r''}"
r""

f"r''"

elementalwarrior: Mocking acts really strangely. You need to mock the function
call in the calling file OR you do an import and change the function on the
imported module object (not a from statement)

!wtf

## Stream Visions

## Learnings

## Ponderings

Its ok to entertain religious thoughts (blindly following), but you just got to
changing where you hang out.

No universal opinions in programming
And you change your mind every momeny

Phaqui: but, there are certainly objective criterias for well designed vs
"hacked together" Can you do well-designed stuff, if you don't have money or
customers

I can be at company and write awesome, well thought out code,
and we burning money
Then we die
Then that code
IS NOT AWESOME THOUGHTFUL

Your Company Experience or University greatly impact your tolerance
for Hacks

Don't work, why don't you just test everything?
Why don't you design?

## The Dreamm

Wake Up Early and Code Whatever I want for Fun
Learn Whatever I want for Fun

- Cube Betting
- Soundeffect Economy
- Auto-generated Music -> guitar solos, stream intros (copyrightfree music)

## Quotes

dougthecoder: OK I just figured out the annoyance with foo and bar. When you
learn a new concept you need to go from known to unknown, from concrete to
abstract. The code you look at should mix something you know (concrete use case)
with the new unknown method of doing it.

Go from concrete to abstract:

- One Example
- 2 Example
- 3 Examples
- You see the patterns

dougthecoder: (Rant Over)
