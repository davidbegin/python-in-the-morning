## Viewer Questions

crazytech44: @beginbot does this programming project help you develop your
knowledge outside of work?

elremingu: hey folks, @beginbot how good is your Tsugaru Kaikyo Fuyugeshiki now,
hands still bleeding?

Q: crazytech44: @beginbot if you were not a programmer and in order to make a Dev
portfolio, would you ever consider doing a free project for a company?

A: Short Answer is yes
A: Long Answer is no

The less you charge for something in programming, the more annoying
the client is, typically the less fulfilling

Do something for free, but you need to setup strict boundaries:

- How Long you gonna work on it
- How you gonna support

nomorequity: Do it for free, charge for support
beginbot: Disagree! Support is hell on your early projects and clients.

- Be careful of people who want you to do stuff for free.
- Real 'business people', know code costs money
  - If someone is cool with not paying you, it's probably not a project

lan_four: For the theme what links are valid, besides youtube?

- Youtube
- Twitch Clips
- Soundcloud
- Youtube-DL: <https://youtube-dl.org/>

whoisjudy: Why not everyone?
Beginbot, if this talkking about love, then heres the reason:

- What does Love Do?
- Every time mana and street cred is dropped, you get more, based
    on how many people love you.

whoisjudy: Just to be clear, are you like this on your own?
beginbot: What does "This" mean

## Questions

## Learnings

## Ponderings

As I develop, and people ask questions on Stream, I notice:

- Gaps in knowledge
- Notice opinions that developed, but not explored or documented
- Notice biases towards certains things
- Experiment with Code patterns in a simpler code base

Typical Emote Style -> Just aint me
cartoony
