# Python in the morning

All taken from my morning streams, where we attempt to improve our Python skills: https://www.twitch.tv/beginbot

This repo contains Code, Notes, Ramblings, and Performance Tests from my morning Python Learning essions.

The first 16 days were unorganized so they are all just dumped into [Days 1-16 Folder](Days1-16/)
From here on out every Day will have a its own folder.

## Participating

Everyday, there will be a PR opened with the Days code, test, ramblings, please feel free to comment, submit changes.
I will merge in the PRs in the morning, after reviewing any comments or additions.

Alternative implementations, other opinions, further expansions on subjects are all welcome!

## Getting Code Review

If you want your code reviewed, or help with looking at a problem, open an issue, and we can schedule to look at it on stream!
