# Python in the morning

All Notes taken from my morning streams,
where we attempt to improve our Programming skills:
<https://www.twitch.tv/beginbot>

This repo contains Code, Notes, Ramblings,
and Performance Tests from my morning Python Learning Sessions.

## Participating

Everyday, there will be a PR opened with the Days code, test,
ramblings, please feel free to comment, submit changes.
I will merge in the PRs in the morning, after reviewing any comments or additions.

Alternative implementations, other opinions,
further expansions on subjects are all welcome!

## Getting Code Review

If you want your code reviewed, or help with looking at a problem,
open an issue, and we can schedule to look at it on stream!
