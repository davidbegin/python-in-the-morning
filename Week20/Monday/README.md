trouble deploying it to google because I have to change the settings.py file and
create an app.yaml file that is turning to be so freaaaakinggggg haaard

We need blog posts written at all times of the learning:

Someone who knows nothing before they started, often is the best blog on the
subject, you got that fresh, make no assumptions.

app.yml confusion

GCP ->

"Theres no good info"

"Theres a huge gap in the market, that I need to solve for myself"???
And if your frustrated, then others will be this frustrated as well,
and your post

hanycodes: @beginbot I just really don't understand why can't there be like 10
steps from 1 to 10 what to do to deploy a django website on google cloud just
specifically what to do without any crazy things. Just something very simple
roballnight: Does anyone have audio desync

:( I can't figure out the problem !!!!
it's so frustrating. so whenever I run this

$ gcloud services enable sqladmin
, ERROR: (gcloud.services.enable) PERMISSION_DENIED: The caller does not have permission

Questions:

- Do you know who is being denied?
- Where are you calling this from?
- Can you copy past the whole stack trace?
- Have you authenticated with local gcloud

Python VSCODE Autocomplete NOT WORKING

## You just walked into a Harley Davis Biker Bar

...hey should I get a Harley
...YESSSS YESSS

Open Source
ALL THE SERVERS IN THE WORLD ARE LINUX
Games are sometimes harder to.

....if you want
Its actually simpler
You have to learn eventually if you program professionally
...unlesss you focus on Windows or Mac only (Thats hell....ya done messed IMO)

IF you want to program for FUN, LINUX is the funniest for a million reasons

People all over, making Linux from scratch
why
why

Have you ever heard of Windows

Debian VS ARch

- Package Manager:
  - Arch: pacman
  - Debian: apt

- Release Cycle
  - Debian: Releases
  - Arch: Rolling Releases

## Things I Hate A ARch

- I HAVE NO FRIENDS
- I HAVE LESS FRINEDS SINCE I SWITCHED
- IT'S NOT GENTOO.....been getting a lot of heat
artmattdank: the worst part about arch: The Gom Jabbar

Worklife -> Servers all Linux 8 years
Personal Computer -> January

## Beginning Advice

Programming is about being able to keep hitting your head against the wall,
you got to strategic about it.

Just Write down What your confused about, how you trying to uncover that
confusion, and then what you learned.

crazytech44: good good still on the job hunt. I was about to get a job couple of
days ago and they were like we decided not to hire any more employees :-/ I was
wondering why they advertised in the first place ðŸ˜‚

Companies are full of single humans making decisions.

This is how companies work:

Boss -> Hiring Manager HIRE SOMEONE
Hiring Manager Finds someone
Boss goes into meeting, NO MORE Hires
Tells HIRING manager now that they found someone
HIRING FREEZE

I've watched happen for months

People Think That Companies Hiring is Logical.
ITs all a Shitshow
It's Not you, its them
They can't make up thier mind
Theres probably 2 people fighting to hire someone or not.

If you are in a tech hub
Find a pitch sesssions meetings: LA, SF, Austin, Seattle

Some  Angel investors:
Shark Tank Style -> hear "enterperuuarsr" pitch their startup

Angels asked question: what would you do with the money

What would they do with the money: Hire Someone who knoiws how AI or ML
....not a single person was technical or has a technical cofounder.
..........still got money
