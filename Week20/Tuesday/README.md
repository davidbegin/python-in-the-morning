vexedkiller0071: How did you know you were ready to apply for job?

bopojoe_: when you need money

vexedkiller0071: ^^^

beginbot: NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW
beginbot: Applying for a jobs, is a separate skill.
Everytime I start the process, it takes 2 interviews to warm up
it really helps align your learning with getting.

IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU GET REJECTED.
I got rejected, manager wrote up some detailed notes,
saying heres why you didn't hire you work on these things.
3 Months.

Some jobs have limits on how often you apply. A Year is long. 6 Months

Job hunting is like Dating
...people treat like it College or Competetion, you beat something, and unlock
the better level.

A meet a lot of newer programmers, who are simplying failing at some aesthics, optics,
marketing to get a job.

Interviews are like Standup Comedy...you are gonna bomb some. If you haven't
done that yet...you got to out and get that done. List some companies,
who you don't really want to work for. Interview, least favorite to favrotie.

Have you looked at jobs you want to get? companies? industries?

vexedkiller0071: not companies or industries
If you are doing QA, because you think it's a Step Stone to programming,
I wouldn't suggest that always, if you aren't looking for a job right now.
Some people get stuck, and end up hating computers.
Others do move into Dev.

2 QA jobs will look NOTHING Alike:

- QA Jobs 1: Hes a script written out for you
    FOLLOW THE SCRIPT UNTIL 5PM

THIS IS AGREAT TRANSISTION TO DEV

- QA Job 2: WE ARE IN CHARGE OF QUALIKTY
    We will use code to ensure the qaility
    Writing automated tests
    Writing Performance measureing Tools
    Testing Tools

It's ok to get rejected to a hundred companines, and be careful
looking for a fit.....for a place you plan on spending at least 40 hours of
week.

vexedkiller0071: I'm just nervous about the whole 4 years of experience for some
jobs

beginbot: No number or experience, or any requirements are real.
    Sometimes you will get hired for a different positions.
    If you go in you tell em, here's who I am, heres what I'm looking for
    whats good. This an interview for a Backend Engineer, QA Team.

2 No-Jobbers:

- One afraid to apply
- One doesn't care
  - This one gets rejected waaaaaay more
  - Waaaaay more embarassing
  - This person gets the better job
  - Then they become smarter
  - Then get a better job

I have seene more people leave tech faster, based off first job being terrrible.

## Begin's Real Advice

punchypenguin: Begin, I need your advice, I'm using Linux machines, docker
containers, python scripts, etc to configure the devices.

Would server versions of Ubuntu be adequate to serve as redunadancy,
or can I use CentOS, with which I'm more familiar with

Redundency for What:

- Servers ->
- Data

Which is better for Stability for Services:

- Centos
- Ubuntu

Beginbot Doesn't Know:
anakimluke: what makes an OS more stable than another?

How often we are updating thangs on the server,
what kind of code are we running (new hot cutting stuff, taht ain't gonna be
supported in LTS Releases?)

When you are building new schedule, schedule times to adjust.
Start Streaming -> Make a schedule and commit for 1 Month
Then at that time, I will make an adjust, and try for another Month.

I wanna stream at night, no mornings, no shorts stream, no long streams.
Ya gonna stream to no one.
Do a Stream, after improve one thing
Do a Strea, improve on thing.
vexedkiller0071: The secret is to stream to an audience of imaginary friends

Hide all numbers, everywhere
All the time, never look at them.
Except at those adjustment times.

September
People would pop in the first month
3/4 viewers
5 ->
8 ->
Sept-Jan

You get that Raid, and then back to number before +1

The idea of playing a video game, is incredibly stressful.

## Rant

reading is awesome, but be careful
because there is whole world of reading, that is the same TV in
my mind.
AKA its for shutting off the mind, not stimulating.

- Reading Something -> where all the conclusions are there for you.
Pop Reading -> Freaknomics, Michael Lewis, Airport Books

If you reading something, and you don't write, think, or talk about your
thoughts as they relate...your missing the big point.P

aphoric: I was just curious
cachesking: hrm... dat pulumi tho. i haven't gone too much further with it. im
interested in the "stacks" concept they have.
aquafunkbot: !props 800807
nomorequity: LUL
aquafunkbot: !me

aphoric: I see.
aphoric: So an interface definition language would define your services in one
language and produce server and client code for you so that all you have to do
is implement the interface
aphoric: It handles all the networking and everything for you
aphoric: I was just curious
