## DevOps / SRE

- how do we write code to deploy things
- How do we write tools, to monitor or debug things
- How do we write tools, to make developers lives easier
  to develop locally or in a sandbox enviironment, before Prod
- How do we build systems that are resiliant to failures

- Set up extra logging around slow queries in DB
- Alert on Slow Queriers in DB
- Hook Up alert, to stopping other DB Traffic
- How do you get code from a Devs machine to Prod, is the safest/fastest/most
  repeatable manner.

- DevOps -> customer is Developers
- SRE -> Customer is Customers

- There some security overlap, but you need a real Security focused ent

## Random Get a Job Fast

Everytime a new hot language, framework, library is realesed,
that actually has legs (how do you you know whern something has legs??)

- You're experience is worth like 5x

- In the first years of Rails or React:
  - 1 year of experience made you senior
  - 3 months meant you were a Junior

werrdd: @beginbot Are there certain types of projects that employers value more
over others when showing examples of your work to get a job?
beginbot: is the project used by other people?
          is it unique:
              - I don't mean an amazing app
                I mean a stats website for Pokemon Go
              - I don't want to see a TODO app
              - I want to see something specific to your interests
              - If you follow a tutorial and build a TODO app or
                anything....that doesn't show you can solve problmes
                it shows you can follow instructions.
                And many people end up in Tutorial Loop of Doom,
                learn more and more syntax, but never solve a
                problem end to end.

2 Programmers:

Programmer 1: Twitter Clone
Programmer 2: Builds a Calculator App for Super Smash Bros Damage

Programmer 1's project might be more complicated overall,
but it doesn't show that the person knows how to use to
code to solve problems.

## Begin Dream

I want to be a calculator....but like the whole thing

## Math Opinions

I only believe in 3 numbers, or technically 1

0 is the father
1 is the song
  infinitty holyghost

1 can get to 0 and infinitity
they are separate but the same

Everuthing exists, as 1, or 0, or infinity
Infinite universesee

1=1
1=2 -> infintisiamlssm
1=3

## Yesterday

- Wanted to start adding Types to our project
- Noticed we needed to upgrade TinyDb to 4

  In Sub Collection on Twitch -> uploaded a new video

## Begin Question

Whats a normal person?
What makes you normal
Do you have tips be normal.
stupac62: Also, for average there is mean, median, and mode that you have to disclose

## Questions

lucasfernsilva: Begin, I`m starting a blog, and I`m in doubt if I will use flask
or django, wich is simpler?

beginbot: flask IS simpler
          ....however are you making a blog for:
              - To learn to how to make a blog -> Flask or Djano
              - to Blog -> (Maintenance)
              - For someone else to blog -> Never!!! (Maintenance)

....Beginners often "build" their blog, and then spend all
their time, fixing, maintaining their blog.........and NOT Blogging.
.....this why there are Static Site generators.
Flask or Django for a blog.......what content do I need to be dynamic???

Aren't I just publishing words at most once

6AM

....IMO: its better to blog on Wordpress consistently, than
have the coolest, built blog....with 1 post

## Learnings

A primitive lock is a synchronization primitive that is not owned by a
particular thread when locked. In Python, it is currently the lowest level
synchronization primitive available, implemented directly by the _thread
extension module.

## Ponderings

## Opinions

- The Humble Bundle -> buy a million "books", doesn't appeal to
me, because I don't have TIME to read a million books,
and I don't think the majority of books that are in bundles are priority,
I would buy it only for a single book.

Why Begin likes the hardway: I don't like the python style
  I like the learning methodolgy.
  TYPE IT
  TYPE IT AGAIN
  GET IT UNDER YOUR FINGERS

I think Reading 1 programming book, very seriously, is better
than ripping than many

## Debates

- I think everyone should have a language specific Gang of Four.
I think the patterns in GOF are important, and used,
but it all depends on your language,
certain patterns make 0 sense in the context.

....People can get caught on Java, and not the pattern.

....anytime some gives you a certificate, THAT IS GIANT RED FLAG TO ME
Often certs are scams, why do I need a cert if I am learning or making
something?
a cert is a trick so you don't notice you didn't accomplish anything....
except get a cert.

Tutorial Loop of Doom
Cert chasing hell

The goal: How can I learn to use code to solve problems:

- A cert does not prove that AT ALL

IT to me -> Not a programmer -> maintaining a companies technology
IT == Sysadmin

## Confessions

## Python Interview

## Begin's Real/Fake Advice

## Real Advice

Why do we need baby-steps for everything:

- You don't need to graduate Linux Distros
- you can just learn on any of them
- Some of them, you just have to learn more info
- .....I thought we liked learning

werrdd: @beginbotbot For someone entirely new to linux does it matter what
distro you use? What do you suggest as a "learner" distro if so?

You are talking to a Cult Member about their cult:

- I'm very biased:

Why do I like I Arch:

- I want to learn!
- Arch Wiki is an amazing resource
- When things break, its your fault
- more control of the whole system
- more customizable to my personality
- .......to look cool

I know Nix Vult members, and their propangana

### Actual Answer

- Pop OS
- Mint

.......why do you need a "learner" distro?
.......why not jump into the pool
.......why don't you just do Arch

- If your head hurts at least once a day from trying to learn programming
you're on the right path
if the head doesn't hurt, you ain't getting smarter

## Quotes

spielprogrammierer: @detlion1643 C# is just a little better clone of Java

## Scraps

## TODO

Why is windows integrating with Linux?
...because sucks and they know that
...and now they'be changed their policy from crush linux
   to take over
   that scares me.
