zanuss: We still going?
lucasfernsilva: !me
detlion1643: must be some kind of learning bot, it's talking about the same stuff that chat has been

"orenog_live4": "personnormalyesplus5"

## COMING SOON

Beginbot Bot Trials

You should be able to accuse someone of being a bot,
and then putting it to a vote:

cachesking: is there a way to open a document with vim and got to a specific
line number in the same command

## DevOps / SRE

- how do we write code to deploy things
- How do we write tools, to monitor or debug things
- How do we write tools, to make developers lives easier
  to develop locally or in a sandbox enviironment, before Prod
- How do we build systems that are resiliant to failures

- Set up extra logging around slow queries in DB
- Alert on Slow Queriers in DB
- Hook Up alert, to stopping other DB Traffic
- How do you get code from a Devs machine to Prod, is the safest/fastest/most
  repeatable manner.

- DevOps -> customer is Developers
- SRE -> Customer is Customers

- There some security overlap, but you need a real Security focused ent

## Random Get a Job Fast

Everytime a new hot language, framework, library is realesed,
that actually has legs (how do you you know whern something has legs??)

- You're experience is worth like 5x

- In the first years of Rails or React:
  - 1 year of experience made you senior
  - 3 months meant you were a Junior

werrdd: @beginbot Are there certain types of projects that employers value more
over others when showing examples of your work to get a job?
beginbot: is the project used by other people?
          is it unique:
              - I don't mean an amazing app
                I mean a stats website for Pokemon Go
              - I don't want to see a TODO app
              - I want to see something specific to your interests
              - If you follow a tutorial and build a TODO app or
                anything....that doesn't show you can solve problmes
                it shows you can follow instructions.
                And many people end up in Tutorial Loop of Doom,
                learn more and more syntax, but never solve a
                problem end to end.

2 Programmers:

Programmer 1: Twitter Clone
Programmer 2: Builds a Calculator App for Super Smash Bros Damage

Programmer 1's project might be more complicated overall,
but it doesn't show that the person knows how to use to
code to solve problems.

## Experieneces

When you talk to someone who is a "real user" of a technology,
NOT MATTER WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY,
they will have some rants.

I learn Graphql, I do a simple site it
I'm hyped on it.....but I don't know all the thorns

Good to be Hyped!
Drink the Kool-Aid
....eventually you shouldtake off the Nikes

- Public Facing Work:
  - Blogs
  - Talks
  - Projeccts (that look nice)
  - Open Source contributions
- Join and Participate:
  - Discord
  - Mailing List
  - Meetups

A random friend, was leaving his company, so was someone else.
The somone else was going to a Stealth Startup,
and was looking for others (since they weren't public recruiter)
He Hooked me up, and thats my job.

ALL JOB DESCRIPTIONS ARE LIESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

I applied for a job, didn't get it
.....3 months later, manager said could you do Angular?
I said OF COURSE (I had done about 1 day of angular),
got hired as a contractor,
......and I just contributing to the backend
and they said thats fine, stay there.

## Begin Dream

I want to be a calculator....but like the whole thing

## Math Opinions

I only believe in 3 numbers, or technically 1

0 is the father
1 is the song
  infinitty holyghost

1 can get to 0 and infinitity
they are separate but the same

Everuthing exists, as 1, or 0, or infinity
Infinite universesee

1=1
1=2 -> infintisiamlssm
1=3

## Yesterday

## Bounties

## Begin Question

Whats a normal person?
What makes you normal
Do you have tips be normal.
stupac62: Also, for average there is mean, median, and mode that you have to disclose

## Viewer Questions

becaree: apart from locking taking hours,i never had any issues ith pipenv really

## Questions

lucasfernsilva: Begin, I`m starting a blog, and I`m in doubt if I will use flask
or django, wich is simpler?

beginbot: flask IS simpler
          ....however are you making a blog for:
              - To learn to how to make a blog -> Flask or Djano
              - to Blog -> (Maintenance)
              - For someone else to blog -> Never!!! (Maintenance)

....Beginners often "build" their blog, and then spend all
their time, fixing, maintaining their blog.........and NOT Blogging.
.....this why there are Static Site generators.
Flask or Django for a blog.......what content do I need to be dynamic???

Aren't I just publishing words at most once

6AM

....IMO: its better to blog on Wordpress consistently, than
have the coolest, built blog....with 1 post

## Learnings

A primitive lock is a synchronization primitive that is not owned by a
particular thread when locked. In Python, it is currently the lowest level
synchronization primitive available, implemented directly by the _thread
extension module.

## Ponderings

## Opinions

- The Humble Bundle -> buy a million "books", doesn't appeal to
me, because I don't have TIME to read a million books,
and I don't think the majority of books that are in bundles are priority,
I would buy it only for a single book.

Why Begin likes the hardway: I don't like the python style
  I like the learning methodolgy.
  TYPE IT
  TYPE IT AGAIN
  GET IT UNDER YOUR FINGERS

I think Reading 1 programming book, very seriously, is better
than ripping than many

## Debates

- I think everyone should have a language specific Gang of Four.
I think the patterns in GOF are important, and used,
but it all depends on your language,
certain patterns make 0 sense in the context.

....People can get caught on Java, and not the pattern.

....anytime some gives you a certificate, THAT IS GIANT RED FLAG TO ME
Often certs are scams, why do I need a cert if I am learning or making
something?
a cert is a trick so you don't notice you didn't accomplish anything....
except get a cert.

Tutorial Loop of Doom
Cert chasing hell

The goal: How can I learn to use code to solve problems:

- A cert does not prove that AT ALL

IT to me -> Not a programmer -> maintaining a companies technology
IT == Sysadmin

## Confessions

## Python Interview

## Begin's Real/Fake Advice

## Real Advice

Why do we need baby-steps for everything:

- You don't need to graduate Linux Distros
- you can just learn on any of them
- Some of them, you just have to learn more info
- .....I thought we liked learning

werrdd: @beginbotbot For someone entirely new to linux does it matter what
distro you use? What do you suggest as a "learner" distro if so?

You are talking to a Cult Member about their cult:

- I'm very biased:

Why do I like I Arch:

- I want to learn!
- Arch Wiki is an amazing resource
- When things break, its your fault
- more control of the whole system
- more customizable to my personality
- .......to look cool

I know Nix Vult members, and their propangana

### Actual Answer

- Pop OS
- Mint

.......why do you need a "learner" distro?
.......why not jump into the pool
.......why don't you just do Arch

- If your head hurts at least once a day from trying to learn programming
you're on the right path
if the head doesn't hurt, you ain't getting smarter

## Quotes

spielprogrammierer: @detlion1643 C# is just a little better clone of Java

## Scraps

## TODO

Why is windows integrating with Linux?
...because sucks and they know that
...and now they'be changed their policy from crush linux
   to take over
   that scares me.

## Begin Philosohy

There is nothing I like more, than some good ole artifical restrictions.

- Didn't Eat Meat for 6 Years (Only on a bet)
- Didn't Drink for a year for fun
- No TV/Movies 10 years
- Wake up before 5AM

You have to build you own social reenforcements:
by me telling chat and friends, I can't wathc things
if I do wathc thnigs, I have people to yell at me
That helps keep me towards my goasl.

Phone doesn't leave the house.

Digital minimalism

- Have to take off rock climbing
- Take it off for Yoga
- Notifcations stressed me out

....so I was just putting it on to work.

I have played disc golf once:

Went with a friend who was really into to it, for a couple months

We are playing, and a big crew was forming behind us
So at one point, he was like, after this throw, ill let yall
pass.

5 people waiting to pass
He throws the "disc" -> Hole in one in front of everyone -> and really far too

SO I said, I quit, I will be never play this game again
and lose my number

## Graphql

Backend Devs -> Make an API

Frontend Devs -> Use the API

New Page, only need the title, and date from API

Hey backend devs give me filtering options
Filter out the data on the frontend
or new endpoint

.......or just do Graphql
And if you need to optimize, a particularlly area,
then you can do that.

In the long wrong, if I was writing a simple, stable,
API, I wouldn't Graphql

So much of the benifit of Graphql is working on Team.
joehaaga: hot take: GraphQL is like CI/CD - it solves an organizational problem
more than a technological problem

Git-Flow -> This is for Organization problems (Not tech problems, henve
why I don't use it alone)
