Mark Twain -> Traveling is the antitode to racism

“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our
people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of
men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the
earth all one's lifetime.” -> Mark Twain

Don't think moving to another country is going to make you happy
If you're not happy in X country, you ain't gonna be in Y country

mrwormhole: i still can not get the idea of CI/CD. Can you explain it for a team
that consists of only one full stack developer LUL

Beginbot: Why should you do CI/CD as a solo-developer.

If I am fullstack freelancer, using a similiar stack over and over again.

Rails and Ember

I build a template, for Rails, Ember Deploying to AWS, Linting, Runnning Tests
Packaging

CI/CD Template.

Unless you are continually:

- maintaining
- large amounts of deploys

The more you code and deploy, after CI/CD the more useful it is.

- If you ever hear someone protective of a server, or a magic build,
  thats their pet, and you gotta separate them from their pet.

## History Repeats itself

## MyPy Learnings / Confusion

When running MyPy, we have a moduel (AudioWorld) being loaded from other Classes
and failing on type interfermce, becasue it couldn't find the module.

Once we added a __init__.py to the module in question, everything worked.
However, apparently since Python 3.3 and PEP420, we have implicit namespaces
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/>

## Theories

```bash
# python -m mypy chat_thief/**/*.py --warn
mypy chat_thief/**/*.py --warn-unused-ignores
```

- Only calling mypy or part of the files **/*/.py *.py
- Running mypy directly, instead of module

## Viewer Questions

jdtaylor11: which python framework to use if I need to rebuild a work order
system?
basically a system to request tests on items and that sort of thing?
might you be able to answer that?

Beginbot: When it comes to library / framework recommendation. From less than
"Random Number" of Pages, all I can do is ask questions.

- What is the current system built on?
- What are the list of responsibilities it needs to handle?
- What python framework / library are we currently using?
- Who is maintaining this?

Flask/Django
Web UI
DataBase

You changing datbases?

Rest-Flask
Django

## Learnings

## Ponderings

When I read, I almost am reading like I'm looking for guitar licks
to incorporate into my playing.

When I'm extracting, and pondering, its to try and incorporate,
test it against my thinking, drink of the koolaid, reject, play with
the idea.

## Experiences

I Wanted to break services sooooo bad. I wanted them tiny.
I wanted to be read all code of any server in an hour.

.....guess what.....just because you separte repos, and separate deploys, and
separates, doesn't mean you have microservices: Distrubed Monolith

Start with Monolith

### Begin in LA

I don't drive
I ride my bike
I walk
I skateboard
I catch a ride
I rideshare

This works: -> I can walk to groceries stories, restaruants, bars.
Quick Bike to work
Friends in the nieghborhood I can walk

Beginbot, I like to big city, But I mostly want a a neighborhood

Things are expensive:

- Bars restaruants wild expensive
- Rent Expensive

meatchops: smaller and startups??? dont you want to work on massive java/C#
  legacy systems in a cubicle and going to meetings about meetings every day??
NotLikeThis

Don't you want to have to do security, frontend, backend, water the plants,
clean the kitchen, stay up all night. Don't you people in your space looking
at renting next month, cuz you're out of money. Don't you want your CEO telling
you, we don't have right now, but hopefully tomorrow we will for Payroll.

Work brand new technlogy, and spend all your time, discovering and fixing
bugs to work with the shiny new thing.

WSYSIWYG PTSD

- One terriblly paid
- Antoher terriblly paid
- slightllt less terrible
- Meet someone who sees you got skills,
  they pay you lil more
- Then you find someone who has lots of work for,
  and you say, I got to charge more.
- Sub contract
- Lead to Contract
- Hire

Freeland
Sub-Contract
Contract To Hire === CAN WORK
Full Time
Full time + Sub contracting ==== NOT AS BAD
Full Time + Contracting ====== TOO MUCH WORK

- 2 Startups
- 2 Smaller

- Don't Start a Startup, with no money coming.
DONT Go raise money with just an idea.

- Start a consulting/freelancing, then work on your product
  as you have money coming

Money doesn't make you happy
Do you know what the day-to-day work of a Data-Scientist
Do you actually know you want to do this everyday for the next 60 years
What if the pay was cut in half, fourth???

## Begin's Real/Fake Advice

## Real Advice

- At your work make a repo called some variety of;

- #dead-code-society

You celebrate all the times you delete a bunch a code.
You are trying to build a culture of pure excitement around deleting code.

### Actual Answer

## Quotes

beginbot: anyone who programmers without types long enough, will invent types
          anyone who types long enough, will dynamically typed language on top
          of the language

cachesking: if you know why you're using the tool
cachesking: you can use any tool
cachesking: the axiom. if you're in types long enough. you'll introduce generics

spielprogrammierer: @mrwormhole no, "var" is inferred at compile time, but with
dynamic it doesn't have a type, I wrote an article about it for one usecase:

<https://medium.com/@frankbuss/using-dynamic-in-c-to-call-overloaded-methods-depending-on-the-runtime-type-bf9ceaad7e8a>

I hate people adding to motors to things:

- skateboard: perfect invention ------ LETS MAKE IT SHITTER, HEAVIER AND HAVE
  ELECTRONICS
- bike: perfect invention ----------- SAME

## Curiousity

Why do people care about peoples desk setups???

- Aren't we all customizing our desks to our interests, frutinure, hobbies,
    space.
- Answer: inspiration
- Why does begin not care, cuz I don't want inspiration,
    I already have ideas and Im too lazy. And if I see someone
    else, theres more homework
- I'm a big iterator, constanlty moving

## Scraps

and applying to different levels of abstractions, pushing
against.
