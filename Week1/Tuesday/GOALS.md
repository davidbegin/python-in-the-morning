Goals
=====
- Learn about Depth/Breadth Search:
  - What are they?
  - Where they come from?
  - Examples in the Python Standard Library?
  - Where are they used?
  - When is one better than the other?
  - What the heck does `O(|V|+|E|)=O(b^{d})` mean?
  - Why we have to worry about:
    - Worst-case performance versus
    - Worst-case space complexity
  - With some Big-O mixed in for fun
  - More exploring of find, awk, ag, grep, fd
