Viewer Questions
================

Resume Reviewer:
----------------
- What is the job you are trying to get quicker
- bzzzt_bzzzt: I would just add/remove skills based on the job posting
- rewrite your resume every time you submit
  - If youre  resume over a page, its too long
  - rewrite for clarity




- Move education to the bottom
- Clearer pitch for the job youre getting
- Flip experience, latest first
- Duplicated information, about doing Software test work
Reorganize the tech section:
  - Familiar with
  - Proficent sections
  - Make a ML


Beefs with School:
- Don't work jobs, talk about how things in a job
  - What do you mean you don't 100% test coverage
  - What do you mean you have tech debt
- Too much money
- Learn how to learn yourself


Things Ive seen Juniors not know out of school:
- Git
- Database Normaliations
- Writing Tests


Are there software engineering degrees in the US?


Why would you go to school:
- Research study all day
  - Someone has to pay for you


Can you find a company, and do half-work/research


I can be sued for making blogs for Candas without the proper certificate


Questions
=========
 - What is the difference in procedure and function:
   - procedure no return
   - function we got a return
   - This is only for a specific context

- Did Algo68 differentiate between produce and function



- Command and query
  - Side-effect versus pure


Learnings
=========

Thus, the nature of the backslash is fundamentally different from the percent character, which printf() would see and interpret at run-time.)

minimum­length but maximum­information names



Procedure names should reflect what they do; function names should reflect what they return.

Ponderings
==========

Thinking about compilers:
- Separate out generated of the machine code from the running

pretty printers mechanically produce pretty output that accentuates irrelevant detail in the program, which is as sensible as putting all the prepositions in English text in bold font. 

Opinions
========

bzzzt_bzzzt: IMO the length of the variable name is related to the frequency of use of it, if its used frequently it should be short, if used infrequently it should be longer



UsuallyHigh: I didn't see the whole code, but the one tip I always give people is to use early returns, it's the simplest and fastest way to improve code quality and readability. And no useless if else statements that just return True or False, just combine it in a single line.

I learned HTML + CSS, what next?
================================
Frameworks:
  - Django
  - React
  - Vue

Mininimal Build Up Approach:
- SCSS?  SASS?
- HTML Templating Language
- Vanilla JS

Is your goal to get a job or learn to a program?


When you start with a framework you end up typing magic for 
w while, and not understanding how things

Vanilla Javascript then React

CSS-Grid
tailwindcss

Things Begin's Doesn't recommend:
- Coffeescript



Personality Type:
- Like to make things up on your own
  - are you a customizer?
  - are you a hobby boy
- or more a team player





-  Everything will eventually be version-control


- if someone tries to msake me learn C++, Ima use Rust


- When is it appropiate to use C and not Rust:
  - Domain of work is what Im interested
  - if compile times are a problem, Rust could be tough

What can C do that Rust can't?

isidentical: rust depends on llvm backends so its limits go up to llvms



What languages have the biggest bugs of all time happened?


Is C is faster than Rust?



How long are peoples test suites?
How long are peoples compile times?

Development depends on hardware also


Does Rust compile too slow to work in?

Magic Strings or Variables need a longer name


Debates
=======

isidentical: LLVM is cool but however their foundation isn't

Maths or Math

Is Math invented or discovered?

Python Interview
================
- Why is python merging with update or {**, **} not commutative?

Quotes

TODO
====
- Automate uploading the topic to nightbot
- have a Dmenu prompt to get escape characters...Suckless way
- convert bookmarks to git and use dmenu from now on
- Tmux refresh, or adjust the setbg script


Quiz
====
- Who knows the most escape characters


Dvoark
Colemak
Workmak

Should I remap hjkl, in those
