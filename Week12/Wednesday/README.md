## Philosophy

### Develop Bot Philosophy

- Ban the Bots
- Bots all have Human Rights
- It's Bot's job to not let us know they are bot
  - If a bot is useful and helping the conversation,
    then why is it less valuable than a human conversation.
    Why can't we depend the same social proof system,
    to supress bots
  - The problem, is when one person controls many bots

## Beginbot World Bot Policy

- Everyone gets one bot
- Your bot acts as a familiar
- If we find out you you have than one bot, you will banned
from the economy

---

This is legalizly bots, but regulating them.

Bots do typically help their master
One per bot per person

Stealing from Github and getting it work,
is better than no bot
Thats the beginning of the journey

ocrazytech44: @beginbot what's the best work methodology have you ever worked in?
e.g waterfall etc

Work Methologies are on thing in books and training and another in practice.
Beware of Scrum Coaches
Beware of Agile Training
Bewaaaaarare

Waterfall -> This is how certain types of development must work

Agile -> Certain Companies should run this way for feedback

<https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html>

I am kinda a Kanban Kultist
Toyota -> Bottleneck based workflow

Love Pair Programming
Worked at heavy pair programming places
enjoy it
need to set some ground rules
flip
flip pairs

3 Pair Positions:

- Peer and Peer
  - Some of the most fun I've had on the job
  - Big fan of TDD, bouce pairing
- Junior and Senior
  - this is when you learn tons
  - YOU MUST TYPE
  - Begin learned: Git, Tmux, English, Philosophy, Unix
- Senior and Junior
  - This is you are not Typing!!!
  - You have to watch closely and identify missing gaps in their knowledge
  - Really rewarding

spfar: What is living the dream?
begin: Every dream is unique
ðŸ¦˜
 "The Dream" -> Do things I like, Learn Things, Make Things, Joke Around
                Jamz
This is the dream: Enlightment is realizing this is the dream.

I saw a lot of random stuff all the time, without thinking
I live in a Vim Cave Alone, lots of time alone, so I actual spend
significant amount of time, thinking and pondering, writing about
what is the dream, etc?

We all should ponder more, sit still and do nothing, journal our silly thoughts

How is LA?
All locked down
but people are emerging more
more bikers
people are freaking out, since they say we might be lock down til June

beetle3d: q: why not use alacritty instead of st
<https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty?>

Is there any choice in programming, that I ever really worked through.

Why am I using ST and Not Alritty?
I have not finished exploring ST. Alacritty's on the list.
Alacritty is very fast:

- Have I ever thought to myself, damn ST is slow
- looking for speed might be premature optimization

Redis is a really useful, backend dev technology.

Everything

People are afraid to step backwards to go forwards.
You got a job making $70, and if you switch to programming your at 50
you don't want to do

Are you into house repair
I've never not injured trying to fix anything.

How can we figure a bot is a not a Bot?

Buy a house you want to live in
Buy a house for investment

Get a job you like
Get a job for money

- you have bot in the name

- DO NOT PAY TO MONEY TO SOMEONE

## Begin's Programming Learning Theory

It's faster to learn for free
Learning in a paid manner, puts on a track for
more learning in a paid manner, and doesn't teach you how to
break down.

Knowing how/what to learn is the import skill

NOT THE KNOWLEDGE

All the stuff you become an expert could be gone in 3 years, 5 years.

Hey I took a million courses and now everyones on REact
now I got to buy new course
