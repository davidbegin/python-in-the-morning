Twitch Practice:

## Philosophy

### Develop Bot Philosophy

- Ban the Bots
- Bots all have Human Rights
- It's Bot's job to not let us know they are bot
  - If a bot is useful and helping the conversation,
    then why is it less valuable than a human conversation.
    Why can't we depend the same social proof system,
    to supress bots
  - The problem, is when one person controls many bots

## Beginbot World Bot Policy

- Everyone gets one bot
- Your bot acts as a familiar
- If we find out you you have than one bot, you will banned
from the economy

This is legalizly bots, but regulating them.

Bots do typically help their master
One per bot per person

## Personal Learning Coding Opinion

It's like Music or Sports - NOT a a test based thing

You have to practice a lot, and it's you do each thing one time.
Millions of times
