## Musings

Don't worry about interviews
Interviews are a silly broken process
Don't focus on how to get past interviews
Focus on learning, providing value, making things

Good Interview Experience:

- Sat down with a code case and a bug
- Paired with another engineer to find where the bug is and solve
- If a company wants whitebaord algs......and your job is not selling how to
  solve whiteboard algs, then I don't want to work.

Theres lot of programming jobs, don't worry about IF you will get a job,
Worry about building skills and finding the Right fit.

crazytech44: @beginbot how many hours of coding per day would you recommend for
someone new to programming

Quality NOT Quantity

- sitting down for 30 mins and doing hardcore learning,
is waaaaay better than a 10 hours, just copy and pasting, and banging.

crazytech44: @beginbot how many hrs per day you spend coding?

8 Hours -> an amazing lonely saturday
2 Hours
3 Hours??

Code For Fun
and Code For Work
Coding Relaxing

Beginbot: Very Stupid
          Avoid a bunch of negative hobbies
          TV / Movies

9PM - Bedtime
9:30

spfar: What is your advise on taking breaks between coding sessions? 2 hour blocks?
begin: 25 mins, 5 min break, do 4 for a longer break
I take breaks when Its hard work, and progress is slow.

Sometimes, 4 hours no break happens (but only when )

How do you avoid the internet:

- Make it harder for yourself to go to sites you waste

gamerhani123: Did you have a problem with remembering code ??
begin: anyone who doesn't is a freak and you don't need to worry about

When I'm really stuck:

- Work
  - Reach out to a coworker
- personal
  - Knowledge Spiral
  - What are the areas in this problem I just DON't understand

stupac62: @beginbotbot can your co-anchors name be Stu Pidazzo?

## Experiences

Every company ive worked at, theres always arguments about testing,
it always comes down to the definitions of tests.

Integration versus Acceptance

Person 1: You need an integration test!
Person 2: NO you need an acceptance test

Person 1: Thats an integration test
Person 2: No tahts an acceptance tes!
