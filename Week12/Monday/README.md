## Viewer Questions

with pytest.raises vs @pytest.mark.xfail(raises=...)

moiids: I have to make a variable that takes 3 inputs and prints the middle
output (or the median)
function that takes input
function (3)

we want you fishing, we want to give you fish
moiids advice:
Write up tests, using your function, with different inputs, and handwriting
the right outputs.
Then try and make it pass.
If you can't make it pass, then you should have to code to share.

Step 1:
Write a test for a function that doesn't exist, with the desired inputs and
the outputs.

Step 2:
Write that function and try and make it pass

## About Me

I hate websites, I don't like websites that are real interactive.
I like plain HTML.
