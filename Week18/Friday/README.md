zanuss: Re-use rideordie code to give victims a temporary boost

awfulwaffl3: @beginbot Successful stealing should up your Notoriety .. which
then increases your percentage change to be caught stealing. Somerhing small
like .5% per success. Notoriety could then be used to grant a higher payout of
items being given as a reward for the arresst. BUT the higher the Notoriety the
more likely items stolen would not be able to be recoved.

If you get some alone time, or some chores, so personal learning
BEFORE entering in the world that day.
EVERYTHING is less stressful

Wake Up Earlier, -> After Im gonna work on X

Fun Pairing Session

I was trying to reduce vestigial database commits, around our payment for
performance.

IN what scenario, would this could path
Paired with a Coworker:

begin question: How can we hit this code path

coworker: Who wrote this
coworker: How do they think about writing code
coworker: Get into the mind that coworker

We get soooo focused on the Code itself, we forget the human element.
Git Praise / Blame -> Is only half the story

This person wrote it
The date they wrote it
Commit message

Git Emotions ->  HOW WERE YOU FEELING WHILE YOU CODING

Survey -> 3-5 questions
