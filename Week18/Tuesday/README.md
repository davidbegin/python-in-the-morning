## Debugging Ideas

- Really important, to follow a logical line from your code, to third parties.
- Is AWS down? Is Twitch Down?

Jr Boss -> Bugs come from Data changes. Can you separate all the places, where
data is being updated, from being read

What is variable shadowing
REusing a variable name for somethign different
Why is this bad?
You might get confused on what you are working

u = User1
u = User2

THEM
Who else is testing 1+1 = 2
Who responsonbility is it to test this?

if 1+1 == doesn't equal 2 in Python, we got bigger
If you were interacting with a library

import UrlParser

b2 did changes was pulled to main as well as b1 (finished a version or something
like that).

now I want b1 and b2 to be copies of main, how do i do that

## Beginner Advice

It's good to know where the Holy Wars in Coding Exists

What python books you recommend

Fluent Python

- Already Program want to learn Python

### Holy Grounds

- Version Control
- Microservices Versus Monolith
- TDD, Tests, Coverage
- Agile, Kanban, XP Programming, Scrume
- OO and Functional Programming
- ANY LANGAUGE
- OSs
- farzher: garbage collection
- punchypenguin: open source vs free

## Questions

## Learnings

## Ponderings

What is refactoring:
Changing Code, without changing Behavoir
Looking for the right homes for your coded
Drawing the right boundaries

How do we determine what are the right boundaries.

Ask ourselves:

- Does this code relate to all the other code?
- Does this code sit at the same level of abstraction?
  - One thing talks to a database
  - One thing directly interacts with User Forms
  - One class is generic actions for a User
    - Theres a lot of code, that is only for buying

## Opinions

## Git Advice in College

- Focus on:
  - writing Excellent Commit Messages
  - rebasing, early and often
  - Focus on small logical commits
  - Focus on NOT Commit things you don't want

- when you have git problems focus on fixing them with tools:
  - git rebase
  - git reflog
  - git bisect

This Git commit Adds: ""

Whats important for Git Beginners is developing Habits:

- Commit Early and Often
- Descriptive Commit Messages
- Merge early and often (Don't Break things)

Common Beginner Wrong Git Path

- Want to commit ONE GIANT COMMIT
  - Try and find the bug now!!!
  - If you do wsm

If you do have commits, like Linting.
Then those should be automated, and the commit should be separate from code
changes.

If you have 1000 lines of linting......that won't happened everyday.
So just do a commit of the Styles.

andrelamus: What should be the length of a git commit?
50 Characters -> Top Line

As much info in the bottom as you want

godworrior1: My 0.02$ -> A test is a declaration of an assumption, that you can
also execute to see if the assumption is correct. After making a change you can
re-validate your assumptions about your program by re-running the tests. Having
a comprehensive test suite is great for your sanity.

## Debates

Craft Beer is hard....since 2/3rds aren't craft
but fakes from inbev

Anti-Tests:

You: Unit tests help you find bugs in specfic units of Code
Haters: Uhhhh most bugs are from a complex scenario, and testing each unit
        will find NO bugs.

## Confessions

cachesking: i am fully against locally testing. i think sam and sam local and
dockerized testing. I got into this job to be a cowboy. the the CI/CD sherrif
didn't catch it, it's good code

Our applications:
  -> Run them serverless
  -> Docker Container

-> Locally its actually Less Apps, but act as many of function

punchypenguin: Tests pay off when it is optimized to slightly stretch your abilties

## Scraps

## Storytime

At one point, people me and ArtMattDank, worked at Total Wine,
because we showed up with clipboards.

Making HTML and CSS Pages
You learn about Sass
Then the internets, hey you need to compile your SCSS to CSS,
heres how to do it on the Terminal

I opened that Terminal, and haven't left it since then.
