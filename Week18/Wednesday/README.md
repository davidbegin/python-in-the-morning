## Begin(ner|bot) Advice

When you code professsionally, often you don't know what you're doing, its the first
time doing it.
New language, new database, new concepts.

People have a wierd misconception about programming: you learn everything in 4
years, and just use that knowledge. IN MY EXPERIENCE, all knowledge is useless
after years. Have to learn something everyday.

Coding is a Craft
its a life long journey.
We need the journey

When you are learning programming, listening to any and all advice, and then
take it all with a grain of salt.

Never Used Windows
....Then why are you soo angry at Windows
beginbot: go work on an open source project
          sooooo many windows specific issues
          people who submit windows issues, are sometimes (in my experience all
          the time) lazy jerks.
