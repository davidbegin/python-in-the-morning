bopojoe_: ah ok
jr_boss: @beginbot maybe (or maybe not) you should make the bot and it's owner
have a shared "wallet" (as coolpoints, sfx, street cred etc.)
bopojoe_: !me
mousedown: yes. yes I have
conscience

## The OG Dream

Other Coders: Buy a Stream Deck, add some sounds, trigger themselvees

Beginbot:

- I'm lazy

- i don't want to find the sounds
- i don't to trigger the sounds
- I want the great sound/gif/joke triggers ever to get access to powers
  by demonstrating their value in the chat???

## Bugs

- We don't allow bots and creators to props and steal from each other
- Props ALLOWS RANDOM PROPS
- Sometimes the random person choosen is the bot

- Bug in Cube Solving;
  - You need no sounds to enter
  - We need it to cost sounds to enter,
  - Further more, you should be able to bet all sounds
  - THE BUG: we allow people to enter without sounds

personnormalyes

## Done

- No Blind Stealing
- You have to register as a bot

## Goals

- Work on our Thief/Stealing mode
  - Hook up to Coup
- Start Bot Survivor
- Start Homepage Fashion Show

## Bots Rights

Creator

## Why These Goals

- Instead of fixing bugs, we must get more systems running with more bugs.
- Features over Stability

## Bot Survivor

### Bot Survivor TODOs

BotVote

- We have to build a simple bot voting system
- Build Bot Tribal Coucil
- Protected Sounds

### Problem With our Bots

What is the current incentive off all bots: To serve their master, cause one bot
per user.

We need to add new feedback loops into the bot cycle.
How do we have humans promote which bots they like:

- People say "I like this bot"
- People say "My highest preference is remove THIS bot"

Then at the end of each round, which will be based on a time limit,
everyone will vote for one bot

### What Do You Win

Last Bot Left, gets their name recorded in the Hall Of Fame, and their messages
preserved, along with owner. Also maybe a permanent sound, for that winner.

### Open Questions

- How can we make voting secret???

- jr_boss: why do we want to remove bots?
  beginbot: We want to encourage bots to evolve in way
            in which viewers find them valuable.

Solve the Problem of How to Reward Good Bots and Punish Bad bots,
with Beginbot evening what the bots are doing.

### Bot Model

bot_vote model

- user
- bot

Need a Bot Flag on Users

## Homepage Fashion Show

Everyone votes for one persons homepage,
at the end of the day we, calculate the winner, and then thier
page gets added to the hall of fame

Everyone votes in chat with !bestcss @user

## The Government is Corrupt

Removed Everyones permissions from Coup
Lowered the Price to 100
Removed everyones Cool Points and Street Cred
Halved the Price of all Commands

## Other Worlds to Build ArtMattWorld

- Geoguesser

How can we let the chat all contribute their guesses with the sound system.

Take this project -> Extract a Sub project

- Set of List of Soundeffects
  - All be countries, states, sounds that point to locations
- Every user has access to all commands:
  - Strict limit on how many they can play per time interval

## Bounties

- Sound for every country
- Sounds for continent
- Sound for every US State
- Any and all sounds that if heard, would point to somewhere on a map

## Welcome To BeginWorld

Hey What do I code?

- CSS Project -> Style your own Page
  - <https://mygeoangelfirespace.city>

- Every user can have 1 bot in the chat
- Any lang you want

## Refactors

- Continue to Refactor the Command Model
- Refactor and Document more of the project

### Begin Builds a Ethical 24/7 Animal Channel

- The people have to helping
- They can't just watch
- Cats
- Chat control chat things
- Cats are happy
- Take donations

## Viewer Questions

evilhomerdude: I'm learning Arduino programming. Any suggestions?
beginbot: Whats your project, whens the deadline.

justcinema1: does anyone know why when I run like linux mint its laggy and stuff
questions: Why programs are running lagging? How are you measuring lagginess?
          Whats programs are hogging up all Good Bits?

## Viewer Advice

jr_boss: @beginbot maybe (or maybe not) you should make the bot and it's owner
have a shared "wallet" (as coolpoints, sfx, street cred etc.)

jr_boss: and when a user has x complaints something happens
jr_boss: complaint to the police
eitanfuturo: maybe commands like props without specific user or random keyword
should point to one in best friends list.
cachesking: the quickest turn-around on my bot is to do a naive buy and donate.

## Begin Ideas

I like ya being here

If you want to get better at programming, that is probably (100%) done
alone in silence programming learning

You learn things watching stream: Fun, inspiration, communitity, ideas,
learning ziegest of the programming world ,which leads to more comfort.

I don't want you hear to stay and watch me for me.
I want you to do whatever makes you happiest

Theory: Programming on Twitch is very small and early stages.
        It is NOT A zero-sum game.
        Spread the love, find someone whose streaming something hypes.

## Begin(ner|bot) Advice

determin1st: Спасибо за PridePog, @faolan437
faolan437: i think the thing that scares me about open source is i look at bugs
that are labeled first time bug or easy and can barely understand the problem or
how to start finding the bug

If you think that, a million others think that.

### Your Mission

Write Down What you don't Understand
Do Research into all those things
Relook at the problem
Repeat until you are either stuck, or think you have some concrete
questions about the problem to ask about.

Reach out in

## Begin's Unethical Getting a Job Advice

## Begin's Advice when ya Hatin'

When you notice that your hating
and even better you got rants

Then thats time, to write down:

- what you hate
- why you hate it
- What it causes you to do
- What you'd like
- Do some research if anyone is doing it the way you invision
- Write Blogpost on research/explorations
- ???
- Happiness

Haters have better info to share, but they have to organize it,
remove the emotions and vagueness.

## Ponderings

## Opinions

## Beginworld Ponderings

It's easier for the poor to steal from the rich

One Rich person wants to steal from another Rich person
So they contract Poor Person to Steal, in exchange for a Props Reward,
or transfer of another sound

## Begin's Worst Advice

deni1111: print("\033[91m") ???????

Sometimes I look forward to Tedious IF:

Sometimes, I'm like, what if they don't they want to watch anymore
what if they get bored

Do what makes me happy, and is interesting and others will like

2 Days in a row, Begin stayed late -> Playing Geoguesser friends
12 -> 5 -> 5:30

Saturday:

Woke up, cleaned my apartment, listened to a podcast
3 hour bike and hangout
Read
Cleaned
Read
Wrote

....then I felt about not working on anything for the stream.

So I just writing ideas

## Hunter S Tompson

It was said that during this time he would sneak off into a room with a
typewriter and rewrite his favorite author’s books such as F. Scott Fitzgerald’s
The Great Gastby and Ernest Hemmingway’s A Farewell to Arms.

In Music -> Playing Note for Note Covers is 100% expected

In Writing -> the idea of writing rewriting an already novel

Hlpes you act as someone else, then you learn how to tap into yourself

you interalize rhythm and the choice

## Quotes

## Rants

Anyone who says you're not a programmer is not a cool person

Anyone who does gatekeep, is trying to protect thier own Ego.
Why would you care if someone calls themself something you Also identify
with.

You're afraid people will associate that other person, who you've deemed
lower with you, and that hurts your ego. And that means you afraid other
people think are dumb, which means you are a GIANT LOSER WORRIED about
if people think dumb.

## TODO

## If you are blank slate

I got nothing but questions
I have no advice

What intests (outside of programming)
What are you good at that others aren't
Waht can read about all day
Do you like creating new things, or editing?
Do you visual things, or the opposite of visual
How do you feel about problem solving
Are you a people person?

I DO NOT WANT TO HELP YOU LEARN TO PROGRAM AND THEN HATE YOUR LIFE

There are people out there, who really enjoy the act of programming,
Not the outcomes, and it pays well.

Also there are a million different types/ways/vibes of programming.

If you are trying to learn
if we can we find a area, that is super fun and interesting
you will progress faster.
