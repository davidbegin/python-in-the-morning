## TODO

## One Goal

Separate ourselves from our Ego

We don't want to get smarter
We want to be ok, with how ever we are
And learn, for the sake of learning, and not to fill some
Egoic desires

## 2 Choices in Life

Resilience
Resistance

Scenario: You stream, and someone goes HOLY SHIT YOU ARE SOOOO DUMB
Result:   It hurts the Ego

Resilience -> Be Ok with people thinking and saying ur done
Resistance -> Don't stream any

2 Systems:

- NO BUG IN THE SYSTEM, RESIST ALL BUGS
  - Huge QA times, overly complicated test suites, maintence windows
    a company that grinds to halt
- How we handle as many bugs as possible, assuming everything will
  break, then design

## Cube Thoughts

Right now, you win the number of sounds you are away from the exact answer,
max of 10.

Bet 39 - Cube 39 - 10 Sounds
Bet 34 - Cube 39 - 6 Sounds

Find me X users for the Sounds you won.

20 People Bet and someone one. Only 10 would lose sounds
YOU CANT BET IF YOU GOT NO SOUNDS

- all betters lose sounds
- the winner can win a porition of those sounds
