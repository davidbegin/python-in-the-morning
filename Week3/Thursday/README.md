Code Review / Resume / Github / Interview Thursday - Plus Arch Vim Tmux I3
Ricing

Code is a mix of art and science, learning what is "good" code is a life-long
debate. We are here to figure out what is the best attitude to learning, while
simultaneously presenting ourselves in the best position to make $$$$$$.

## System Goals

- Kick off various chat commands, from i3, vim, tmux

## Bounties

- stupac62: Didnâ€™t chef steal code from that open source dev?

## Viewer Questions

- My autocomplete is slow what to do?
  - What is your current autocomplete
  - How does it work
  - What happens that autocomplete slow

- Disk1of5: I am working on a open source twitch bot and i am working on a way
  so it doesn't spam.. i want to write all messages to a MessagePool and have
  the pool send out the message but make sure there is a delay between sending
  messages... so im working on an async function that checks an array
  Disk1of5: the hurdle im having is creating the loop that checks the array

## Questions

## Learnings

strager: vivax, I think that logger.exception outside an explicit except block is a bad idea. Pass exc_info explicitly.

BIGFATOROPERATOR is \|. It's called the alternation operator. In PCRE, it's plain |. It's escaped in Vim/ex because | is used elsewhere for general commands

- use :echomsg to explicitly write a message

## Ponderings

- Between Docker and Suckless
  - Docker - install nothing on your system,
  - Suckless - Source based configuration
  - This tug and pull is hurting me

## Advice

If you have a school, still make it look an open source.
Separate Repo, README, running instructions, License (MIT)

## Opinions

- If touching a mouse is bad, then touching a streamdeck is worse

- It is really easy to script AWS infra stuff, but it's a Trap!
  - Continually more error handling, case handling, determining the
    state of the system in you code:
  - Choose Your Fighter: Terraform, Cloudformation, Pulumi, CDK

- We should only practice practical comments, don't write comments
that wouldn't exist code

Code Commenting incredible value
Bad Comments incredibly damaging
We want to practice Good practices always

- Braintax for music is real

- Docker is a skill used for everyjob

freedomdao: it's a very frustrating problem . Recently someone bought a
corporation that uses the platform i build with. they decided to use corporation
to try and kill the entire platform. 100s of us were building on it.

## TODO

- fltrdr

## Vivax Twitchbot

- start with a README
- I don't like projects that start with the langauge
- sample_config.json
- config.example.json
- dotenv might cool to explore - very useful - 12 factor kids

for and else

if the loop finishes run the else, only feels right, if the loops goal
   is to find something
