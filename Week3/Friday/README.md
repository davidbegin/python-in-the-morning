Friday ADHD python vim tmux arch linux debates madness freedom

It is Friday. I don't have to work. I have to travel.
I want to continue to bridge the gap between Vim/Bash and Twitchchat,
but if anything else comes up, I am going to let my ADHD take me away.

## Improvements to the Stream

- beginbot
  - Vim shortcuts for posting the current line in vim to twitch
  - `<leader>tw`
- beginchat
  - Command for copying last lines of text from twitch chat
    - `<leader>tr`
  - Command for searching for comments in Twitchchat and
    - `<leader>tu`
    adding to vim buffer
- shortcut to pull up common chat commands with dmenu
  - te
  - `<leader>te`

- Take a usersname, and make em, VIP, i ``<leader>vip vim

stupac62: You should SEARCH before installing. Just in case

## Ponderings

When we ask ourselves, we often are asking ourselves a bash statement
Example: arbaya: How do you generate a random string in vim? Put arbaya in front
of vim and ask him to save and exit.

How do you generate a random string in unix/bash land ???

How do I search all the manpages
