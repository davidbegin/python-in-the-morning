## Rework Chat

a "Command" is also created and added to the command list

## Goals

## BeginWorld Economic Flaws

We have to fix goverment hand-outs:

Currently: we can drop any soundeffects however much want.
Next     : All sounds given to people, will cost money from the  goverment.

Start of the Stream:

- The cost of all the commands is halved
- that amount is allocated to the government
  - Need a Government Account
- When soundeffects are dropped for the people
  it will cost that amount from the goverment to droppeffects

## TMUX Life Crisis

## Confessions

Parents tricked me:

5th Grade:

- built a sysytem, where we points for finishing books
- we could use those those points, to buy more books

## Ponderings

We do have people taking advantage of the sytem
However, that happens in any system.
So we need to not look at the indivuals
but instead the machines of the system
and adjusted the parametes ourself

Goverment isn't done yet, we are working out the system

You have 2 options when improving your typing:

- Have your computer fix more things more things for you
- Improve your actually typing

Has you code more, the size of problems will grow, and then take more time.
You're totally stuck, you shouldn't be banging your head.

Stuck on a problem for 5 days:

- Sending random into a class for 5 days, hoping itll work
- Tried this, leared about that, lead me this, which lead me that
  found out I need to this.

crazytech44: I met a Dev today in person who's got over a decade of dev
experience in Sydney and he told me "you shouldn't spend more than 2 days on any
problem" otherwise you won't make it. He also told me in order for you to make
it, put aside at least 5 hours everyday to learn logic/programming.

put aside at least 5 hours.

beginbot personally: I think you should focus on the quality of learning in the
beginning:

2 Beginners:

- Obsessed with "hours"
  - I DID 12 HOURS YESTERDAY
  - HOW MANY HOURS A DAY
  - AHHH I CANT GET IN 12 SO I WAONT PROIGRAM
  - AHHHH I STAYED ALL NIGHT TO BE A HAKCER
  - DIDNT LEARN ANYTHING

Can you do 30 mins, or real intense learning
Should be mentally tiring

## Musings

zolor: I'm still working on overcoming imposter syndrome, I think 10 years
experience will do the trick zolor: Well that's not reassuring LUL
beginbot: Our goal is not to stop feeling dumb, its to be ok
          exisiting in that state.
          Courage is not the abcenese of fear, its standing
          to fear.

disk1of5: @beginbot Impostor syndrome i think the end results of employers
asking for almost unachievable experiences in technology.. for example.. an
entry level position with 5 year experience and 10 degrees..

Beginbot: Tech is soooo wide and diverse....I can do some backend programming
  someone wathcing we do frontend......they'd uh....have you ever programming
