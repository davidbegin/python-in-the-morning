## BeginWorld Economic Flaws

We have to fix goverment hand-outs:

Currently: we can drop any soundeffects however much want.
Next     : All sounds given to people, will cost money from the  goverment.

Start of the Stream:

- The cost of all the commands is halved
- that amount is allocated to the government
  - Need a Government Account
- When soundeffects are dropped for the people
  it will cost that amount from the goverment to droppeffects

line2: this is line two you had the cursor at the end of line 1, pressed a key
and the whole line2 flipped to the end of line1 does that make sense ? :D btw
