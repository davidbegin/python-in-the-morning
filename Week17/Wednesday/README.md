## Tommorrow

- Rework the website:
	- Show total sounds
	- organize by new wealth
	- add help info on user page about Custom CSS

- Add Goverment Taxes
- Sound Auction

## Powers of the People

!share
!give
!steal

-> those actions can make the market
-> I expect Escrow viewers to become a thing

## Sev-2

When updating a user soundeffect,
a "Command" is also created and added to the command list

## Today

- New Concept of Weatlth - Cool Points + Value SFX Assets
- When the goverment gives out sounds, they must pay
- When sound costs are halved, that is essentially taxes

## Goals

- Save Cube Times
- Store Econ Stats
- Upload Econ Stats to site
- Fix the donate
- Fix cube drop
- Build Government taxes

- Typically war used to short term 40-day thing
- Kings used to raise some money temporarily, lotta time through the church
- When were Taxes
  - When were All taxes invented

## BeginWorld Economic Flaws

We have to fix goverment hand-outs:

Currently: we can drop any soundeffects however much want.
Next     : All sounds given to people, will cost money from the  goverment.

Start of the Stream:

- The cost of all the commands is halved
- that amount is allocated to the government
  - Need a Government Account
- When soundeffects are dropped for the people
  it will cost that amount from the goverment to droppeffects

## What Constitutes a Winner of the Homepage

Everyday Money Resets but Not Sounds:

- Everyday, is a new persons change to take over the homepage

- Cool Points
- Soundeffects

Total

- Costs

## Done

## Economic Changes

Ride or Die: You get extra Mana Not Street Cred
Restart: Removed all money, not sounds, cut the cost in half

Working with emmet-vim

!css CSS_URL

Facebook is worst website of all time.

One of the most important reasons why:
it said oh MySpace, where everyone customize their pages

We are the Darkest Timelime,
And I think the split was at Myspace to Facebook

The rewmoving of users ability to add custom CSS to their
own Page, HAD RADICAL IMPLICATIOHNS.

## Opinions

## Viewer Advice

hackcodeariel: @beginbot are you a fan of comments within your code?
beginbot: Comments should explain why not how
They should highlight unusual things, that are tricky
and someone might not understand in the future
comments are Lies waiting to happen
If the code could be made more clear and elimiate the comment,
obviously thats what you want.

A comment for comments sake is dangerous.

No Path, More of a Mindset

Beginbot: Don't think about "Paths" when it comes to jobs.
Don't think about position or title.

You: Skillz
Them: Problemz

Us: Can this be a good match

Interview: Tips to cram before an interview
Jobs are Relationship

What do I want to learn
Where do I want to help
Who do I want to work with

Think Long Term

Rejecting a couple, getting rejected from a couple more,
can result in a real nice life.

Job interview, you are actually scouting future best.

JOb Interviews will talk 6 people:

- You might really live 1 of those people
- You are excited to work and learn with them
- .....then you find out....you never will work with that
- find out what your team would be....not just the interbiew team
