## BeginWorld Economic Flaws

We have to fix goverment hand-outs:

Currently: we can drop any soundeffects however much want.
Next     : All sounds given to people, will cost money from the  goverment.

Start of the Stream:

- The cost of all the commands is halved
- that amount is allocated to the government
  - Need a Government Account
- When soundeffects are dropped for the people
  it will cost that amount from the goverment to droppeffects

## What Constitutes a Winner of the Homepage

Everyday Money Resets but Not Sounds:

- Everyday, is a new persons change to take over the homepage

- Cool Points
- Soundeffects

Total

- Costs

## Done

## Economic Changes

Ride or Die: You get extra Mana Not Street Cred
Restart: Removed all money, not sounds, cut the cost in half

!css CSS_URL

Facebook is worst website of all time.

One of the most important reasons why:
it said oh MySpace, where everyone customize their pages

We are the Darkest Timelime,
And I think the split was at Myspace to Facebook

The rewmoving of users ability to add custom CSS to their
own Page, HAD RADICAL IMPLICATIOHNS.
