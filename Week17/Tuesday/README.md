Facebook is worst website of all time.

One of the most important reasons why:
it said oh MySpace, where everyone customize their pages

We are the Darkest Timelime,
And I think the split was at Myspace to Facebook

The rewmoving of users ability to add custom CSS to their
own Page, HAD RADICAL IMPLICATIOHNS.

## Ponderings

Testing Bash?

- Should you have soo much "Bash" that is needs to be tested
- Is Bash not just Glue
- Why would need a framework to test, when typically that only operate on files
  and processes

r_u_ri_ui: Testing is almost never overkill.
beginbot: 2 ways tests can kill you:

- Bad Test: Tests are constantly being updated, becasuse of:
  - Mocking too deps
  - Too much test setup
  - Area is super unstable
  - Flapping Tests

Beginbot Mission:

- Tests don't return their investment until they catch a bug

## Musings

- You hear pop songs (harmonically simple), and they stay in a couple basic
  moods.
- You don't just happy for 3 mins straight
- You feel lots and lots of serious of subtle different emojis, that are
  flickering from on the next.

- If you seek separation from your hands and mind, you'll never reach,
  because striving is thinking about it.
