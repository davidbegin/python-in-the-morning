## Problem

I want to show the last updated CSS sites.
I don't know that until I generate the site

- Generate the Full Site HTML
  - I want to include info from the diff stage
  - I could shell out to a diff, like I do in the next step
- Diff new version against the old version
- Sync the diff

  - We used to:
    - Bankrupt everyone
    - Remove all commands
    - Cut the costs in half
  - Now:
    - Bankrupt
    - Cut the costs in half

- What Pages were updated CSS wise on the homepage
  - New Styles
- command to remove all sounds that are user soundeffects

Facebook is worst website of all time.

One of the most important reasons why:
it said oh MySpace, where everyone customize their pages

We are the Darkest Timelime,
And I think the split was at Myspace to Facebook

The rewmoving of users ability to add custom CSS to their
own Page, HAD RADICAL IMPLICATIOHNS.

## Begin Junior Advice

- Don't be afraid to delete code
- Don't be afraid to throw out code

"But I worked at that for 2 weeks for nothing!!!!!"
beginbot: "2 weeks of learning, research and experience"

Scamers on youtube trying to say GET RICH HACK THE GOOGLE/FACEBOOK
INTERVIEW, GET RICH

.....people don't realize tech is constantly moving....if you
don't like to program
you going to hate your life

.....it doesn't matter if you make mroe money
....you going to be surrounded by hyperactive nerds like
who do lvbe it.

## Experiences

Often time as you get more experienced programming, you write
less code

more time on harder problems
less code

When I newer, a common way of solving a problem would be:

- Throw paint at the wall, solve it, it sucks
- Start over, little better still sucks
- Start over, now we got it.

- Research
- Timeboxing of some experiments
- Proposal Writing

## Work Goal

Never taken a sick day
....Now I take days
but I say, hey I don't want to work today

...I'm sick

Once every 3 months:

Celebrate Sad Day

- Wear burlap sack
- Not allowed to sit on fruniture
- Only allowed -> cold hot dogs
- No Media of anysort

- listen to dad songs

## Debates

## Quotes

## Scraps

## Later

- Write up sad days post
- If celebrate some sad days, then regular boring are nicer
