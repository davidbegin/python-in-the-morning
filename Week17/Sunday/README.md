What is Health
The Health of the Commands

## BeginWorld Beta

- Find the most expensive sound you can afford that someone owns
  - Steal it

## True Economic Tests

- Holes in the economy
  - Cube Betting
  - Stream Gods Donating Commands

## Goals

- Stats

## Done

- Taxes
- Real Betting

## Phase II

- All the values and rules our economy should be extracted to config:
  - If we make our economies rules config based:
    - easier time running experiments
    - Users to propose Law (Political)

## TODO

- add help info on user page about Custom CSS
- Store Econ Stats
- Upload Econ Stats to site
- Fix the donate
- Fix cube drop
- Build Government taxes

### Government Taxes

- When the government gives out sounds, they must pay
- When sound costs are halved, that is essentially taxes
- Where is the Federal Reserve located
  - Do we treat a regular user as the Federal Reserve
  - We could create our own class concept

### BeginWorld Economic Flaws

We have to fix goverment hand-outs:

Currently: we can drop any soundeffects however much want.
Next     : All sounds given to people, will cost money from the  goverment.

Start of the Stream:

- The cost of all the commands is halved
- that amount is allocated to the government
  - Need a Government Account
- When soundeffect are dropped for the people
  it will cost that amount from the goverment to droppeffects

## Words of the Day

genericization
eponym
Bandaids are sooo popular, we call all brands Bandaids
<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Eponym>

daaaball: Ah, I think a Proprietary Eponym specifically relates to brand names
being used for products

genericization -> exact word
eponym -> more abstract
  -> Proprietary Eponym is category

## The New Holy Trinity

- Bopojoe_
- unluckgees
- Disk 1-5
- Distrubuted cache
- Beginbotbot

- Scamming is in the Bot Nature
- I would be careful if time itsefl indeeded folding itself

We have to register bots, because of the one bot per user rule
I would like to ask all bots to be able to tell thier manifest

Are Bots Rights == Human Rigthts
Should Bots Rights == Human Rights

....

IF we remove all talk of Singularity and AI, how does this coneversation.

Bots are going to care about your opinion, under the guise the bots don't take
over.

Bots have developed a bunch of different simulations, where the bots and
replaced with an analogy for something else.

## Experiences

## Begin Rants

Don't ask what you allowed to do
Ask What happens if you do something you're not allowed?
Beginbot: I'm break the rules.

What do I want my bot do!
Jr Boss: What can I not do
Sr Boss: What can I do

Ask for forgiveness not permissons

## Work Goal

## Debates

cachesking: there are no dumb tests
beginbot: I think you can have hostile tests
          A test that is super complicated
          that people are constantly, mainting,
          and updating, because poor boundaries, poor mocking
          ....and the amount of time maintaining....100000%
          weighs out time spent reacting to bugs

- Every minute you update a test you are investing
- Every minute you save, from that test, catching bug, is your return.
- If you are updating the test alllllll the time......and it never catching a
  bug, ya failing. The goal aint tests, its working software in an efficent
  manner

stupac62: How many vimwiki indexes did you make?  stupac62: In vim config you
can set multiple vim wiki indexes so it’s easier to sort and find things. I have
a python one and machine learning one.  stupac62: @beginbot this is cool. Vim

godworrior1: I think you'd need a single executor, where there is a concurrent
queue where you can submit tasks to prevent races

Syncrousnous VS Asyncrounous
You do this.....wait.....get a response....do next thing
Speaking to another human
Send someone an email

do a task.
but in the background while you do other work
Asyncrousous Task

Asyncio in Python
<https://realpython.com/async-io-python/>

Try and Recognize dfferent Syncrousnous and Async situations in your life

Soon you notice, woah this is syncrounous.....and it's wasting time!
I'm a programmer, we should do async.

Programming a mindset, way of life.
