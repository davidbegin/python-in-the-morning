serjio_sa: What do you think about learning burnout? As i said, Im in the final year of school. Before I Learned about a lot of things. That was fun. But now my brain didnt want to solve even medium difficulties. Did you have similar problem?

2 Separate Things:

- Burnout
- Doing things that don't have stakes for you

- What are the real overarching goals I have
- What am I working on to get there

Boring Project, super annoying legacy code, nothing works
no motivation

- Tons of Legacy Code out there
- Everyone thinks its annoying to work with
- I need to become an expert in making it not annoying
- Why is annoying...I don't understand X
- Do I want X, if yes, boom I got some motivation

Get Burnout:
- Back Up
- Write Down what your goals are
- What you are dreading working on
- Why you dreading it
- What would you want to work on

Healthy Habits:
- Worked out
- Meditated
- Read
- Journaled
- Drank Water
- Have you got off the Internet for 24 hours









myusernamefrank: for me it is the opposite, I guess this is the reason for some
hype, like everyone has some PTSD for some languages, and then they all want to
learn this new best thing ever, like Go or Rust





johncvv: For a while now I've had apple PTSD, but now my wife got an IPad, its

growing on me.

myusernamefrank: regarding the sound, I did a comparison video of timidity and fluidsynth with the same song, and I think some instruments of the fluidsynth soundfont are better, but overall timidity sounds much better: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywvrzXv36Os>

and timidity.

JS vs Python -> Try both out, explore the communities, and projects,
                and general vibes. Ask yourself, which makes you more
                excited.

                It should be exciting learning! If you don't feel
                that, I would look at what you are learning, and
                how you are learning.

You should learn a language a year.

When you getting started:

- Pick one you are excited about, and can have fun doing a lot
  of.

  So much of your language preference, depends on problems you solve,
  but also your programming PTSD.
  NO NO NO PYTHON IS TERRIBLe
  - One time at this job, we had this terrible python codebase.

myusernamefrank: 15 years ago I wrote a program with which you could create your
own Flash animations, based on templates, was quite successful:

back in my day HerbPerve JS was like a salad dressing and your salad was Python
spfar: there is no one language, it depends where you need it for. I use several
languages
