Not a Job

Movement

Company Organization

As programmers as time goes on, jobs get combined.

Used to be a Designer and then Frontend dev.

One day, the tools got good enough, for one person to do it.
Then there the designer can make decisions that impact the development.

Developer making apps
Ops team deploy the apps

"Throw it over the wall"

Devs write code
Ops deploy code

Ops job keeps things stable
Devs job ship code

This means War.

What is the best way to keep things stable?
Nothing change.

Devlopers ship code
Developers write tools to ship code
DevOps Developers help write tools to ship and monitor
