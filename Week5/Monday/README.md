quadran7: Flash question, should you write comments to describe every dependency
in a package.json?  quadran7: I don't think it is necessary, lol

Depends:

DO YOU HAVE TO:

- How's your time sensitivity
- How's your legal requirements

That's beautiful to comment everything
And mysterious ones you should
would someone see a package and ask why do we need this in our app

Documentation should exist on one-level:

Example: JS Library, should not teach JS
It's for generating maps, some basic map info might

Question: Do you plan on working in?
          Then reada about package.json

Counter Argument: Forces people to ask themselves, why they pulled in
  so it could be temp and then you delete some superfluous as well
  the docs

Have Bassoons started the most Riots?

artmattdank: The tumult began not long after the ballet's opening notes — a
meandering and eerily high-pitched bassoon solo that elicited laughter and
derision from many in the audience. The jeers became louder as the orchestra
progressed into more cacophonous territory, with its pounding percussion and
jarring rhythms escalating in tandem with the tensions inside the recently
opened Théâtre des Champs-Élysées.

artmattdank: " French Romantic composer Camille Saint-Saens is said to have
fumed: “if that is a bassoon then I am a baboon!” He then stormed out of the
theater."
