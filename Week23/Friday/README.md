## Viewer Questions

lucasfernsilva: Vim supports go?
beginbot: What does supporting a language mean

- Should your editor compile things for you?

What are you cool with doing with NO audience?
So how long would you be cool, talking to yourself???

Coding on Twitch Life:

- Turn off every single number, follower, viewer, everything,
don't look at any stats EVER EVER EVER....unless you had a couple weeks and
you're curious

Bitrates important

Audio is the most important

Make ya font big

## Big 3 Advice

- Never Shutup like theres a million people watching
- Audio First
- Consistency is King
  - Have a schedule
  - Stick to it

......You wait

stupac62: Have your friends or family watch. cuz having 1 viewer is better to
accumulate others than having 0

beginbot: You want your first "fans", "viewers", "regulars" to
  be people you don't know....unless they are people who
  are into this

People get their friends and family, and make a clique,
that isn't "new" or a new community for people.
