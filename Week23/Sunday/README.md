## Code Sabbath

- Soundtrack -> Steve Reich
- It makes no sense to ask someone how they are doing on the Code Sabbath
  The Code Sabbath is not about you, it's about the code.
  No Judgment about your day.
  Celebrating the Code
- Look at community projects, anything the people worked on
- Reflecting on Code
- Talking about Code

Beginbot I'm an contrarian, sorry.

So I say if you have the time, then Arch is an excellent Beginner Linux Distro.
I am NOT Saying it's an Easy distro.
You will learn a TON. You will have to read a TON.

- Archwiki incredible...you just got to read all of it...and over and over
  again.

- Why do people play Dark Souls???
  Hard is fun
  Arch can similar

## Breaking into Software as a Person who knows nothing

- Have a good idea of where you want to work
  - What type of development do you like?
    - Frontend
    - Backend
    - Client
    - Product
    - DevOps
  - What companies are you going to apply for?
    - What do they look for ?
  - What type of learner are?
    - Hands on, experience
      -> Startups great
    - Like lots of Structure/Guidance
      -> Sometimes (Bigger companies)
  - What do you like doing that everyone else hates:
    - High pressure situations -> things are on fire.
    - Tedious, cleaning up, adjusted, editing
    - Do you like visually working with things
    - Do you like working with people?
      - if you hate people, you want to a avoid client-facing work

Example of Young Begin:

- I want to be at a small Startup
- Ruby
- Backend Microservices
- Testing
- Strong Junior Mentoring culture
- Company to be a cause that interests.

## How do you prove to people you got the Skills

- Gotta be Blogging
- Gotta be joining communities
  - Local Meetups (excellent if you can)
  - Online Communities:
    - Slack
    - Gittr
    - Discord
    - Examples:
      - Start broad, and look for more specific
      - Python Discord
        - Flask Discord
          - Flask-CSRF library Discord
    - Twitch
    - Twitter
- Personal Projects
  - Done:
    - not a WIP
    - Can be small
    - Good Readme and breakdown of what you did
    - Proving you can build something
    - Should not be a clone of something else.
      - Any variation works
      - Doing it from scratch works
- Join the Open source World
  - Learning how you can help
  - You see bad Docs, you update those bad docs!
    - You're first Open Source commits


Why no clones:

- Clones means following a tutorial, or blog series, or Youtube and series and
  building along.
- The important skill you need to prove:
  - you can solve problems, WITHOUT BEING TOLD the solution.
- Clone/Follow along are training wheels.
- And in my experience people can't get off them. Until
