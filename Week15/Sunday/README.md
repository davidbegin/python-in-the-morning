## Viewer Questions

hitokiri_battousaitv: truly sucks when you want to ask a programming question,
but you know the answer is keep coding lol
beginbot: the skill we are trying to build, is how to ask the right question
          we need to be more comfortable living in the Pit of Imposter Land

hitokiri_battousaitv: but its soo real but dammit
yassine_supergodbomber: is there a way to implement 2 or more views in one view
                        in django?
                        nested views
                        iframe???
yassine_supergodbomber: every view has one get_queryset with return just one view

beginbot: I wanted less heavy weight
          against SQLite
          If I was going to use a relational DB,
          I would use the one I was planning on using
          in Production.

## Musings

Javascript:

- Is your site fast, easy to navigate, have real content,
back button work?
- Then why are you adding Javascript
You can use Javascript, but if your site sucks just HTML
you are polishing a BAD Website

I enjoy talking about history, polictics, philiopshy......as long as you
don't think you know everything, and you are ok, with load and loads of jokes.

Time Theory

Once we expose an API and people build off of it, then its harder
to change the data.

I'm still moving stuff around in the DB
Build out a simple HTML website, and as we notice
database normalization problems, then update.
Then once we have fixed our DB Model, then expose
as an API.

Determine the JSON Format First.

Current DB Model Concerns:

- No Foreign Keys
- Typically we are using name of user or command as the primary ID

## Experiences

## Debates

loner_lena: Fedora people are nice people @beginbot . they are on the good side.

ubuntu: they just don't realize they have been compromised (Truman Show)

dnf Versus Pacman

ssp3xx: @beginbot I like dnf because it has a stable cli interface. I think
fedora actually has 3 package managers; rpm, yum, and dnf.  ssp3xx: dnf is
generally the good one

Stable CLI interface:
Beginbot: Examples of an unstable CLI interface:
apt, pacman, rpm
I've not noticed instability

ssp3xx: apt is generally unstable
ssp3xx: In my experience
ssp3xx: @beginbot or example, "sudo apt list | grep "package or regex something"
will throw a note saying apt does not have a stable cli interface so be careful.
dnf doesn't throw a note like that.

jlabelle71: USB 3.5" 1.44MB Floppy Disk Drive
jlabelle71: Can we go back to the good days?

Have you ever heard of Windows from Scratch?
No
Linux from scratch
Must be easier

ssp3xx: @beginbot Fedora also ships default gnome, and not vomit colored ubuntu
specific gnome.
beginbot: YOU THINK I'M GONNA USE THE DEFAULT

c4tfive: Amazon sponsors them, thats why LUL

andrelamus: I dont know, I just want a general linux distributin, ubuntu felt a
lot like a general OS, and not specific tool like kali linux

lan_four: What's the worst that can happen for giving up a little bit of
sensitive information ? Keepo

levinson2504: I used Linux was really good, now mx. I can't arch because my WiFi
card isn't supported

porokon7: I suggest Debian or Fedora instead, why used a derivative that just
makes things more fancy
beginbot: Why would you buy strawberry flavored kit-kat?
        It's just fun!
        I wanna collect!
        I feel like I can be more me
        Oh you use mint
        I use chocolate mint
        Oh you use chocolate
        I use etc.

c4tfive: I use minimal install Debian, never had an update brick my OS like
Manjaro did LUL
beginbot: why so many Manjaro horror stories
c4tfive: Manjaro like, lost a resource for LightDM and so i couldnt even log in.
Could still use a TTY, but ill be damned if im going to track down some littler
resource for a login screen LUL
Why you switch from Fedora to Manjaro?

Manjaras Mask?

porokon7: I suggest Debian or Fedora instead, why used a derivative that just
makes things more fancy
porokon7: I think we are too patronizing to new users of
Linux, we should assume that they have a handful of synapses
r_u_ri_ui: Manjaro's Mac.
codeshow: Newest Fedora is too bleeding edge, some packages was not working for
me, I had no free time to debug the problems then Manjaro just worked out of the
box

## Confessions

Beginbot: This is my first Linux Distro I've worked on
        Arch
        Yes I have to learn things
        They are things I need to learn

whatthehekk321: For me, building something like an OS or Framework from scratch
sounds like some godlike crap....... aaaaand I type extra slow,

porokon7: Only a big brain person like Terry Davis can do that

## Scraps

## Later

According to Larry Wall(1), the original author of the Perl programming
language, there are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience
and Hubris

Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy
expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will
find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many
questions about it.  Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being
lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but
actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.  Hubris: The quality that
makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad
things about.
