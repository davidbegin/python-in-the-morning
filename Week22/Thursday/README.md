## Teacher Rant

I don't remember 95% of my teachers
The only ones I remember, repeating the same thing over and over again.
I think that's the only strategy for teaching.

Learning Programming it's a Mindset

How can you give the person, the tools, or community to continue on.
A teacher is NEVER going to be one to really make someone understand
programming, thats themselves.

So your job, is show them, heres how people learn, heres places to go
for help. Heres some non-obvious advice (Pros DuckDuckGo Everything, no one
knows what their doing, we all terrible)

It's super easy, but if it fails down,
it's really hard to get up.

## Confessions

dataismydrug: Starcraft came out and everyone at my school was playing it, I
wanted to but my father refused to buy me a computer. So I walked to the dump
yard every week, frankenstein'd thrown away computers, and built my first
computer that way to play SC. The rest is history LUL

## Quotes

dataismydrug: "It Depends" is the best measure of how senior of a developer you
are. The more knowledge and experience you have, the more "It Depends" becomes
the answer to even the most simple of questions LUL

artmattdank: you are famous! can you sign my oauth token?!

- It's because we generate only a single page for brand new users,
however, sometimes the other syncing script runs at the same time.
And thinks we should delete all users except the new one.
