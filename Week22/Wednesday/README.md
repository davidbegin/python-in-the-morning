# 2020 - 7 - 5

## 3 Daily Goals

- Everyday you must embarrass yourself
- Everyday you must make your brain hurt and feel soooo dumb
- Everyday do something that scares you

.........ask someone how to pronounce something
....that'd you've been avoiding for a month

Alternate path from work.

If you do struggle with embarassment
I find it useful to take the worst case scenario to the final outcome

I want to ask this coder for help
....but I feel like might think im dumb

They think I'm dumb
They start a campaign to tell the world how dumb I am
The write a blogpost on the dumbest person they know
They make 100 videos, roasting you

They might talk shit???

## Viewer Questions

lucasfernsilva: @beginbot do you have any tips to sleep? its been more than 1
week that I try to exercise, to stop using the computer 1 hour before sleep, and
nothing works, I just dont feel sleepy, for example, I`m woke up for more than
30 hours, and I dont even feel tired

What time are you waking up at?

Melotin -> not tooo often

Often times when you can't sleep at night....you're not tired yet,
You need a week of being tired.

What time do you want to go to sleep?
Lay in Bed at that time.
Find a peaceful book (buddism) (NOT TECH BOOKS, NOT SCIFI) (Nothing stimulating)

- It's easy to sleep, if I feel accomplished, ready for the next day,
and have all my thoughts.

What made Today Awesome?
What could have gone better?

Mediate for 10,20 mins
Then Journal
Grab a "boring" book

IF you do drink Coffee -> leave a (8) hour window, between
you're last cup and sleep.

lunchboxsushi: @beginbot What's a must do for the first week when joining a new
company in your experience?

Beginbot: Meet everyone

-> schedule (coffee|tea|water)-walks with people from different
departments:

You -> Developer
    -> Designers
    -> QA
    -> PM/POs

When you are onboarding -> Super important to try and
improve the process. So anything conufsing to you, stop
and make it better.

Try and setup 1-1s:
  -> Manager 1-1
  -> Try and Get CTO 1-1 or CEO
