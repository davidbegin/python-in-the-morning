## Determing the Right Language for a Project

- What are you trying to do!
  - Exs:
    - Tons of data processing
    - Machine Learning
    - Distrubuted System
    - Payroll invoentor thang
    - 8bit Game
- What is going to run on?
  - Website
  - dedicated hardware
  - will people download it?
- Who will be maintaining it?
  - Is this a along running project
    - Don't pick some obscure language
- What are going to be the potential technical issues
  - Coordinate lots of Servers
  - Handle billions update to user profiles

## Look for wide smaller set of tools

- Whats your go to scripting langauge
  - python
  - Ruby
  - Lua
- Whats you low-level language

Don't Learn another adjacent languages

Python or Ruby

Go keeps coming up at my jobs, and it's all around me.
So it's part of my life, so its part of life.

Rust is all around, a tool I need in my toolbox (No Real Low-Level Hammers)
