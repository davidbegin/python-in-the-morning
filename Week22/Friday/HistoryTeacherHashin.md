# Goal Make a Calendar

## How do you know you are making progress

- Did you brain hurt that day???

- Did you write down some things you learned?

- Can you do something today you couldn't do yesterday?

- Enjoy Learning

- Everyone disagrees about everything in programming!!!!!!!!!!!

Not Soon you'll be pro....it's RIGHT NOW you can enjoy
programming, learning, making stuff, and ACCEPTING
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

....the more you learn in programming, the more you know you don't know
about programming

The smart you get about programming, the dumber you realize you are.

DON'T COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHERS AT ALL
COMPARE YOURSELF TO YOURSELF YESTERDAY

The Fastest Path to Enlightenment is your Own -> Beginbot

People thinking learning to code is like BEATING A Video a Game.
And they are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO wrong

It's a like learning an instrument and how to write songs.

THERE IS NO SET PATH
IT TAKES LOTS OF PERSONAL PRACTICE
EVERYONES STYLE IS DIFFERENT
EVERYONE GETS INFLUCNES FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
EVERYONE LEARNS OTHER SONGS AND WRITES THEIR OWN.
