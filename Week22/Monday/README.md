## Viewer Questions

lunchboxsushi: @beginbot So recently I've accepted a new job, when do you know
if you've made the right choice? Kind of doubting myself now

Do you write in a journal?
If you do:

- Write down your experience everyday.
  - Frustrations
  - What you liked
  - What scared you
- On Sunday -> Review all the notes.

When you do the review, figure out problem areas,
make a theory on how to make them better and try it.

lunchboxsushi: @beginbot For the past few jobs the constant feedback I have is
that I move to slow on items, lots of times though it's because I'd fix other
things along the way that would slow down the feature development. Any tips on
moving faster aside from the journal idea?

Senior Versus Junior: Senior knows when to Gold Plate and When to Duct Tape

Senior knows when to stop and get distracted, when to stay heads down.

Be the person who will jump on anything....then you don't get anything done on
your main task.

Options:

- Not hop on things
- Define the interrupt time and schedule
  - Make a dedicated interrupt role,
    that week, all unknowns go to you.
    And you have a smaller assigned workload.
- Document everything in your ticketing system.
  - Everytime something interrupt based happens,
    make a ticket, go to your PM/PO Scrum Master,
    and figure out prioiritization.

They will notice, they are opening than closing
....we need to reallocate time.

erikdotdev: punchypenguin I actually work for Microsoft now. Even though I've
been a career Linux person. Microsoft is doing a lot more around OSS. Watching
FB and other companies makes me think that behavior is sort of the adolescent
stage of a company. They are doing the same things Microsoft did when they were
the same age.

Microsoft was an incredible predatory and negative force for open-source for a
longtime.

.........does changing strategy for money, make it ok that you are better?
.........Microsoft is not helping with Open Source for any Altrustic reasons

....What happens when the new CEO comes in, and says woah how many devs
paying to working on free speech.

purplepinapples: yeah, theres always the fear that theyre ganing control on open
source projects to insert their influence there as well

stupac62: @erikdotdev Why can't I have an offline accoutn on
windows? You ahve to disable internet before installing windows in order to make
an offline account.. LAME

erikdotdev: When you think about it Microsoft even in its bad years it always
cared about developers. They always poured money into the developer community,
free events, training, etc. It was just the Windows developer community. Now the
cloud changes everything. Now the developer community has become much larger
that they care about.

Katrina Owen did an amazing talk at GopherCon 2016 called "Mind the Gap" where
she talks about how learning is like a graph. At first you don't have many data
points. You acquire them over time as you acquire more you're able to make new
connections. The more you learn, the more connections that can be made. This is
why we have the illusion of someone learning "fast". Great talk:
