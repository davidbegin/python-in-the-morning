# IDK Man It Just Feels Good











It should feel good

Notice when things feel good

Focus on making things feel good

---

Things That Feel Good To Begin:

- First Finger vibrato on the G String
- Raking into a Bending on the G String with my third finger, into a pull of trill
- Palm Muting Riffing in Minor Keys around the E-A-D Strings
- E-B String low on the fret board, walking down the scale heavy vibrato
- Nanny-Nanny-Boo-Boo (Note Note - Minor 3rd Down - Fourth Up - Og Note)
