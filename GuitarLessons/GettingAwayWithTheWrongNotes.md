# Getting Away With the Wrong Notes

C
up a 5th
down a 4th

Whats the 2 sibling keys if you add a sharp, or a flat (Example: C, G, F)

5th Up
4th Down

C Key
Key G - F#
Key F - Bb

When do these notes sound good in C?

F# -> Sharp 4th -> Lydian -> I Chord

Bb -> Flat 7th -> IV or ii Chord

Take the minor
A Minor

Eb -> Flat 5th -> Blues Note
G# -> Sharp 7th -> Harmonic minor
