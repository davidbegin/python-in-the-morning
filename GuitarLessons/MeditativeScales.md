# Meditative Scales

A practice to improve your ability to feel comfortable expressing yourself on
position on the neck.

Pick a song you like without key changes (key changes cool to add later)
Pick the scale and position you want to practice at

Play the Scale slowly and evenly, trying to listen to the current
note in the song, anticipate what the next note will sound like.
Try to make each note sound as good as possible,
until you suddenly know the next note you want to play
and its not the next in the scale, just unleash and start
improvising and enjoy the Ride! Trying to stay in the moment
if you start flailing, go back to scale.

Try this with different positions, scales, arpeggios, speeds, techniques
(legato, picked) etc.  Make games up and play them
