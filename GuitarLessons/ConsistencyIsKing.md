# Consistency is King

OK so you know when you're playing Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1
and you start the first level, and you don't land your first
trick, you obviously restart the level right?

Well this might be a good speed running technique, this same
philosophy keeps you out of getting better at improvising.

An important key to improvising, is the ability to keep going
no matter what happens, and to even push into unfamiliar new
territory, and not stopping when it doesn't go to plan.

An Exercise that can help push you into the abilty to going no matter what,
or assess where you're at now, is play a solo all consistenting
of a single rhythmic value. IE all 4th notes.

If you can keep an Quarter Note solo interesting, then you are your way!

This is a lot harder than it sounds.

Next Level:

Mix in other note values, but NO RESTS!

---

You've lost the tool of Rhythm from you're toolbox!

You are also forced to keep going no matter what!

How can you use you're other tools
like motifs and volume, slides, bends etc. (adapt to your instrument)

- Will help you learn to get back on Rhythm after failing (failing is part of the
exercise!)
- Will help you discover new connecting paths between areas of comfort
