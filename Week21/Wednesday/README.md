## Survey

marcosesoj: tkinter or kivy?
esheep: kivy is better for cross platform

dreytoxic1: TypeScript, Rust or Golang

What we want:

- Extract Method
- Extract Variable

juscuzryancan: any pointers on starting to walk away from ide's and starting to
use zsh,tmux,vim? i started learning vim through vim diesel, just not sure how
to start learning about that whole new workflow

Beginbot:

Make a document for 2 things:

- List of things you don't know how to do
- List of things you are trying to get under your fingers

We want to be more mindful of how we approach writing, notice when we are
doing inefficient things. When we notice inefficienies, we want to record them.
Then spend time researching Vim/Tmux/Bash/Zsh Ways, find some solutions
you like. Write them down in your doc, of what your practicing, then
refer back to that often.

## Mypy

Untyped Code Base, Options for Adding Types:

- Artisial Hand-crafted types
- <https://github.com/dropbox/pyannotate>
- <https://github.com/instagram/MonkeyType>

## Comparing Libraries

- Number of Stars
- Last Commit
  - What files
  - What was the commit message
  - General Commit history
- Open Issues
- Open PRs
- Number of contributors

## Test and Code Setup

- I. Test and Code Side by Side
- II. Test and Code Separate no structure relationship
- III. Test and Code separate, but mirror Folder Structure

Rubyland -> III.

What do I want to know:

- What are conventions for different langugaes
- Arguments for each.

rockerboo: TBO all my professional life I never wrote a test. But now I write
tests based on what I have learned but no outside feedback.

isidentical: The new github UI looks awfullll. I can't end my constant anger
without just yelling whoever made the decision to put this design as the default
without a way to go back.

## Story

I saw P-Funk with Bootsy when I was 15.

Went with another 15 year old white boy
.....and we were alone, the youngest, and whitest people there.

Parliament, P-Funk, George Clinton -> It's psychedelic, Jam songs.

## Begin is Dumb

- Love it
- Keep doing
- If it's hard, remember it's hard for everyone

Programmers are dumb, and that's ok.
What's more important, is experience, perspective, dumb point of view.

Begin likes to make his life painful:

- Strictest Diet:
  - Vegetables
  - Eggs
  - Salmon
  - Kimchi

- Strict Schuedle
- Strict Deadlines
- Track Everything
- Avoid all distractions
- I had my teeth knocked out last time

- When you restrict your life greatly and focus on producing value, good vibes,
  other things become much more fun. Working out is 10x funnier, talking to Fam,
  10 times funner.

serjio_sa: @beginbot How do you avoid distractions? @beginbot

beginbot: You have to notice triggers.

- When you see you're phone, you might get triggered to check it.
  put it in another room.
- Make things boring: make your phone all black and white.
  things ain't as fun to look at anymore
- are ya meditating -> once you meditate, it's easier to notice, what
  are the repetitive thoughts.

500 People pay me $10 -> I'm good

serjio_sa -> Waking Up give me free months.
  -> Waking up is one the best guided if you want.

quant_engine: Like I get the thing about podcasting but I kinda don't at the
same time? Like its an untapped channel for sure but I am just really wondering
, if contested against things like Youtube for lets say an entertainment product
, if its that good you know or kinda like one of those hype trains

podcasts don't need to be giant, they can be more specialized, and more
personality based.

Begin PolyMath Dream:

- Record Songs
- Youtube Videos
- Write
- Podcasts
- Streams
- 1-1 Sessions

These are my Dreams:

- <https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Algonquin_Round_Table>
- <https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Macy_conferences>

Begin personal I feel a lacking of interesting community and discussion on the
regular.

Diverse, international, Experienced squad, and start building up funner.

Round Table:

- Moving daily call in discord
  - One before Stream -> Australian Crew
  - Afternoon One -> The World
  - Night One -> USA (Night Owls)
  - M - W - F: Moving time - hour long!

## Life at a Startup

- You ever have your CEO say, ok so we don't have payroll right now (paycheck in
   a week), but I've got some meetings....but hey keep working, and don't look
   for other jobs.

- Best Job my life, best people, learned the most, best memories.

## What ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE BEGIN

Startup Called Rival: Software for stadiums

- My company got acquired in the early middle of Covid.
  We are in Live Events, ticketing platform for stadiums.

We are going to be the new NOT messy codebase.
I had a feeling....I wouldn't be staying long.
Also wasn't sure how working together would work.

So Covid kicked up, and they did a round of layoffs. I survived.
Then yesterday, they furloughed the company.

Yesterday: Stream 5:30 AM - 9:30 -> Up Standup call

10 -> Emergenecy -> 10 we aren't a company
-> Dead comapany slacks, did some calls with coworkers,
paced.

I was working at a sTaRtUp, Employee 15, idea was defeat TicketMaster.
Then the World catches on fire.....and we are lucky to actual sell to survive.
....But I don't work at TicketMaster.

Begin's Dream Job: 1st Chair Programming Streamer

Wake up everyday nice and early, do my morning routine.
Stream, whatever I want, learning stuff, code, math, history, philoshpy.
Make content. Read, Ride my Bike. Then talk with friends. I want to repeat.

1 Month Where Begin Has 0 Responsibilities:

Everyday I am going to wake up, and do whatever I want related to the Stream,
Youtube, Blogging, Helping others.

Might look at Developer Advocate Roles,

Starting:
Consulting -> Product

stupac62: how about a neovim plugin to tell me the usage of the plugins I use,
then I can split donations amongst those more fairly.. thoughts? cc teej_dv

BAT -> for Plugins
BUT -> for plugings

teej_dv: that is a cool idea -- could see if the plugins have a
".github/FUNDING.yaml" or something stupac62: I had a similar thought for just
my python packages yesterday too

Fulltime Streamer:

- Youtube Videos
- Podcasts
- Blog Posts
- More 1-1 Opportunities
- More fun Thought out Streams

stupac62: because big companies don't support them
Some companies pay someone

Try lots of avenues for getting money for just programming, and then we will
see.

I hate fake teaching.
I do not want to rip people off
I want to share my love, excitement, time  with others, and being able live.

I don't believe, theres a course for everyone.
Focus on individual efforts, and free-form challenges in the beginning.

2 Things:

- How can I support myself
- How can I figure out this path for others

- Youtube
- Twitch
- Private Mentoring
- Pateron
- Sponsors

OLD:

M - F: 12:30 PM UTC - 4:30 UTC

New:

M-F 1 PM UTC - 7 PM UTC

Stream until 12 PM PST

Then the rest of the day, working on stuff related, code, stream, youtube,
helping people.

dreytoxic1: I meant like using f( or f{V%
zanuss: good on batteries?
dreytoxic1: ohh

Should I learn Vi, Vim, NeoVim:

beginbot: What editor you use DOES NOT MATTER.
  THE IMPACT ON YOU BECOMING A PRODUCTIVE, WELL PAID ENGINEER IS MICROSCOPIC.
  ....however, you are going to sit in an editor all day. So you want it to
  be somewhere you call home. If you're gonna live in the code, you editor, is
  really your house. For ME, Vi, Vim, NeoVim, makes me happy. It's home,
  it's where I wanna hangout all day

onyx_pupper: im using this code combat game to learn python. the logic should be
the same regardless what commands im inputting right?

You are writing a game?
often no.

sojiroz7: How do you develop problem solving skills in terms of programming?
Like how do you think algorithmically? Like how do you conceptualise things in
your head so you can combine things like loops and branch conditions etc? Is it
just practice??

beginbot: sojiroz7 -> beginbot learned on the streets. I think the way you learn
to solve problems, is first:

I. Have real problems: Find projects to do, or contribute
II. Attempt to solve them originally
III. Look up common ways people solve them (or find mentors, someone to help)
IV. Compare how you approached solving to how they didk

Younger and Dumber (still young and dumb), I had a simple app, and I wanted to
start parsing out some HTML. And I had learned the basics of RegExs, and I was
like, uh seems perfect. So I start going down that route to solve a problem (for
a client, subcontracting), more and more problems keep coming up. Finally I do
some research, I talk to some "seniors", and I learn this is a common silly
mistake, and all the reasons why YOU SHOULD NEVER write an HTML parsing code,
unless it's yo job.

Notes are very important during the exploration phase:

- Record every command you ran
- Every thing that confused you
- Every assumption you had.

Once you have this info, someone helping is a Dream!!!!
This is fun for other programmers to help with!

You know what's not fun
....hey how do I do this?
hey what should I look up?
hey how do you solve this?

Hey, I want to do X, and it seems like theres 2 approaches,
do you think this or that is better.

Test-Oriented Development DIFFERENT TDD

I've heard of te

You code, then test

I test, then code...but also sometimes code and then test

isidentical: I choosed 3, only for python. The reason for that is, python
packages grow gradually with addition of both subpackages and modules to
original package. A mirror of that structre will increase the devtime a lot for
external contributors. Whenever someone adds a new feature to like foo.bar.baz,
they will know where to put a test related to that feature.

hellonearthis: yes, tdd, tests come first. tod, code comes, then test made, so
if future changes made then the updates can be tested.

How do you get here?
Former TDDer? Who escaped

hellonearthis: the code is too abstract to start off making tests and it can
take a few pivots to get the coding functional.

- No tests
- Tests After
- TDD
- Mix <- Where I'm at now

quant_engine: Yeah thats funny because there was a time that I was talking to
someone in the financial services industry and it was an AI conference in
London. Its fascinating that the first implementation of machine learning on the
markets was attempted in 1998 (this is mainstream hedge fund btw, Bridgewater
has about 50 Phds working on this right now) .

## How do you learn to Smell Code

novahorizon: I have a parent class method referencing another method that's
empty because all of the subclasses override the empty method. LUL

How do you develop Code Smell sense?

Experience (Smell a lot of code)
Learn classic patterns
Learning classic Code Smells
Write Tests (Testable code is often less stinky)

Common Problem: Is over use of inheritance as a beginner. This leads to
experiences, that help coders get an intuition for smelly code

What makes someone good at writing tests:

- They know the balance between too little and too many tests

How do you learn this balance:

- Step 1: Write too many tests
- Step 2: Write too little tests
- Step 3: Eat some porridge

Go for 100% Test Coverage
Go for every type of test

- Unit
- Integration Tests
- Acceptance Test
- Contract Tests
- Mutation Tests
- Performance Tests
- Smoke Tests

Learn every test tool!

TDD -> TDD is NOT just write tests first

You write the tests first, and make them pass in the simplest manner,
and continue to improve the tests and code in lockstep, to influence the
design of the code.

If the code is more testable, its often "Better".

What makes a test fragile:

What is the point of testing in a Capitalist Society:
Make money

You write tests, and it is supposed save time on writing code,
maintaining code, finding bugs early that would devestate business.

So they are an investment vehicle:

Exchange:

I put X time into tests
I want to make/save Y money from found bugs, easier to maintain code etc.

Every time you spend time updating a test, you are investing more.

What makes something fragile:

- You have to update it often, when there was no change in functionality
- It's flakey and you have to look at it, debug it often
- Often times things are fragile, because they are too tightly coupled.
  Changing one thing, breaks the other.

GOOS

Growing Object Oriented Software Guided By Tests

When a test fails, but you didn't update any related code.
Ask yourself: Why did it fail, how I decouple the test from the other code
change.
