## Viewer Questions

kosmic_klasher: @beginbot Hello, do you know of any websites were I can hook up
with other developers and collaborate on projects together for free or whatever.
beginbot: gitlab, github
<https://www.codetriage.com/>
Look for project: Gitters, Slack, Discord, Mailing Lists.

What are the open source projects you could contribute too!
Do you have one already

kosmic_klasher: Okay thank you! So do I just look for projects I could
contribute to and do I message the repository owner and just tell them I can
work on this part

beginbot: You are asking for peoples free time. So if you ask someone hey how
can I help....thats the same as: Hey heres some new homework for you.
Some people will have time and help.
But...its super important to be self service.

If you see a project, try and find out, if you can help on your own.

Assessing a Repo for Contributions:

- Level of Recent Activity
  - If the last commit is 2 years ago....they probably won't respond
- Open Issues
  - Are there a lot of open issues
  - Are any marked as "Beginner Friendly" or "Good First Time Contribution"
- Is there a CONTRIBUTING.md
Look for project discussion: Gitters, Slack, Discord, Mailing Lists.

## Streamer Questions

teej_dv: begin, do you think every streamer should have their own discord?

Yes, unless you can funnel to another community
    maybe you just funnel people to a NeoVim (slack, Discord)

Who are the coding streamers without discords, whats the difference in community
