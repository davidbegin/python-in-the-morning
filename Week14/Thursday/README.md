endlessmike133: i get motivated to do a project but then i find someone has
already done it 100 times better. i was thinking of building a cli image viewing
app then i found feh and got demotivated.
beginbot: YOU ARE NEW, WHY DO YOU THINK YOU'LL THE BEST EVER
THATS ALL EGO TALK
WELCOME TO PROGRAMMER
GET USED TO AN IDIOT

Person: I don't know what project to work on
begin:  Excellent, we need to work on the skill of
        designing, brainstorming, spiking a project.
nukeslion: As a rookie, ideas for feasible project are difficult for me!
begin:     Ya thinking too big. Small. Super small.

People Who want a Job WAnt a Programming:

- Thinking doing X will them Y
- If they aren't already doing the majority
- How many Treehouse courses until I can make a project
- Then Compettive programming, then later

- I like to write in Emojicode for a weekend
- maybe some smarter
- Fun

Basketball == Programming
Programming == Physical Fitness

Whats the final Goal:

I know nothing about competetive programming, and it makes no sense to me.

Goal: USe computers to solve problmes to provide value, with your unique
perspective
Compettive Programming Goal: Sport

- Solving already solved problems
- For Ego???
- Entertainment??
- Networking
- Fun
- Learn

Beginbot: NO SPORTS OR VIDEO GAMES

- Write songs
- Write things

If you don't understand anything
then thats where you wanna hangout
you wanna hangout with other programmers who know more
and then you absorb

How People Think You Learn: You read something, you understand it

How Begin Learns: You keep hearing variations of the same topic, but
different opinons, and it's all confusing, but soon, I start to get
that this is how this works etc.

## Viewer Questions

Favorite Python CLI Library: Click

eitanfuturo: is it easy to migrate all the configs and plugins from vim to nvim?
beginbot:    yes

whatthehekk321: Disable arrow keys? Why?
beginbot: it's import with vim, or learning anything new,
to drink the koolaid, and try and adopt there way of doing things.
in Vim land, you don't ever touch the arrow keys, cuz its slow!
you are taking hand off the home row
but we have a habit. So we just disable the ability to do the habit.
disable arrows, hang out in normal 70% of the time./disable arrows, hang out in
normal 70% of the timen

dk09_: do you prefer object oriented approach or a script approach while
r_u_ri_ui: @whatthehekk321 So you're not tempted to use them to navigate.
developing a python library
r_u_ri_ui: They're not mutually exclusive.
isidentical: using top-level-functions != script style

lan_four: @crazytech44 Welcome myman
beginbot: Ruby land, its very OO all the time. Everything in a class
functions ain't just defined in files. Python land, thats not the normal.
My personal default, is I wanna OO. But lots of python convetions,
seem to be based on scripted.

stupac62: I wonder what it's like for big repos with many people working on
them. Do you think they have like 5 minutes to get their code into the repo
before they'd have to rebase?

Big Ole Repo:

- Lotta people working in it
- Big ole tests suite that has to pass
- You end up in Jump-rope mode.
- Put up the PR
- Wait for the tests to pass
- After they pass, someone else has merged into master
- So you rebase
- Wait for the tests to pass
- Someone else merged into master
- etc

Mergebot: Mark a PR as mergable after tests are passing:

- Then have ya bot, waiting for the tests to pass, if they do,
  and its rebased on master, it merges itself. If not,
  it rebases itself (And if it hits errors notifications)

thegoat9098: hey man any tips on someone becoming a game engineer
beginbot: don't play or make games
          there are many other game developer
          Tim Beadut
beginbot: start making games
phaqui: Game engineer? Learn math (linear algebra), physics, and systems level
        programming languages.

beginbot: it may be free now...but you just wait.
          why vscode???
          I'm ready to be sold, no sellers
          Vim is hard.
          How is it funner
