- Save cube times, with !cubed

- When an issue you submit is fixed, you should get something
  special bug finder sounds
  What are bug finder sounds

- Expose User infomation
  - Upload the JSON at regular times, somewhere public.
    S3
    Prices

- beginbotbot

  - Where all Trading happens
  - News Will Automatically

## Exposing User Data Plan

- S3
- Website
- weather site

Twitch Practice:

- filtering bot talk for the on screen chat
- I'm watch full screen that chat.
- Not the real chat.

## Bot Feedback

teamultrahal: heres an idea : Base the cube's progress with the Programs
progress, when u solve 1 puzzle, u solve the other. Let the race begin. On a
personal note, i suspect we suffer from the same thing. That said: Listen to
this. I refuse to water myself down because you cant handle me at 100 proof
<<<----- Bravo Sir . code MONSTER that u are.

stupac62: Bots should automatically just give cred back to users
stupac62: I mean a random user
beginbot: this is the next step in bots rights. We are accepting
          bots exist.
zerostheory: if you use bots to give yourself props doesn't that defeat the
purpose of cool points to begin with?
          The key, is you limit 1 bot per person,or like a familiar.
qwertimer: how do you tell
beginbot:  Hey how did China enforce, one child per family?
beginbot:  If you caught with 2 bots, you are kicked from the economy.
beginbot:  Bot Turing Test

Reading through texts, Salem had a similiar with witches.
Build a witchhunt feature.

How do we enforce 1 Bot per user.
Beginworld Goverment doesn't time to police, so we most
mobilize the people.
So peole need to be able to accuse other users of being a bot:
Put a user on trial.

What happens if you are found:

- Guilty
- Innocent

## Advice

Speed is byproduct of efficency
If you want to get fast
Slow down, and reduce waste between your motions
No drugs required
Ice in the Veins
joehaaga: Also develop the ability to focus on the higher level goal rather than
the individual steps/commands joehaaga: I always forget what I’m doing when I
focus too much on individual bash commands

## Opinions

## Viewer Questions

stupac62: do you evaluate startup opportunities based on vesting schedule and options?
beginbot: I am looking for the standard rate for my area.
beginbot is changing: Moving DHH, Equity....don't give people a quarter of a
percent  and work em like dogs. Buy them good, if you have a big buyout,
take care of your goddamn people.
stupac62: Hearing my friend talk about stock options and the sheer cost it is to
purchase the stock from the options, it's kind of ridiculous.
beginbot: Just because some got rich from working in tech, doesn't mean
if you follow thier path you will. This is heavily luck and gambling.
You can go for it. Make sure you like your life during the gamlbing

You need a bunch who yell at you to try specific things:

- NixOS
- Alacritty
- DWM
- Qtile

## Ponderings

endlessmike133: would you recomend tmux
beginbot: I am daily Tmux user for last 7 years. Can't live without.
          Other tools, encrouch on the features of Tmux, and it can
          hard to determine where to draw the line.
          St - Terminal Emulator
          Tmux - Terminal Multiplexing
          Alacritty has Terminal Multiplexing??
          Kitty has Terminal Multiplexing
          what about Window Manager? Can't taht split like Tmux?
          WHy not split in Vim??

Terminal Emulator
Editor -> Neovim
Terminal Multiplexing -> Tmux
countoren: maybe more like 3 month
nukeslion: I'm not familiar yet so just trying to understand

First we wrote code no tests
then code, then tests
then tests first
NOW, as we write code our customers test

TDD - Twitch Driven Development
What did I learn, coding features and exposing them right away

Streaming Coding on Twitch and allow users to interact with it,
is a new style coding.
Compared, to a typical release style

How do you handle the chaos
prioritizaion
tracking bugs

General/Generic tips to help you manage this process.
Sloppy Python: don't be afraid to just, toss some output in afile
and edit it....but the talk is too specific.
All file manipulation specifics

aciduk: it's basically been a walkthrough of his scripts folder
joehaaga: You might enjoy a book called Superminds; it’s about collective
intelligence and a lot of the concepts are relevant to Twitch Driven Development

## Debates

os.rename, what does that us underneat?
countoren: python is not alot better than bash IMO
countoren: both dynamic langs
countoren: so you use nix
eatpizza22: small python scripts should be bash, big bash scripts should be python
countoren: bash job is to glew programs, nix to bring the dependencies together
and specific program should be written in the right lang for them (the more
compiler the better IMO)
