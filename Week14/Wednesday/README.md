## Open Source Path Advice

r_u_ri_ui: Build things, not homework.
turtle9100: what's wrong with homework?

HW -> Giving you something to complete
Real Work -> Thats your job

Give yourself Homework
Din't take others HW

turtle9100: might you waste a lot of time and learn bad habits if you go off on
your own too soon?  beginbot: You will never learn THE ONLY SKILL YOU ACTUALLY
NEED.....how to teach yourself, how to make your own HW
