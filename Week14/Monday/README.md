Event Driven Programming

82 Lambdas
They are share a dependency
you have to update that dependency on all 82

......do you really have microservices???

Lambda Layers:

We can update a dependency across all apps.
But when do we test, the deps against our service code

helpful_puffin: if Im not enjoying a language, should I drop it and start a new
one that I do enjoy?
beginbot: if you have something you actually do more, then yes.
          but we must be careful of just giving up when things hard.
          also, you need to make sure, you are feeding yourself
          exciting content.
          Java -> There are Java Nerds, who are sooooo excited.
          Find. them, check out what is exciting them/

What matters is what is fun to you.

What excites.
Java exciting you.

Me -> Ruby

druidmuffin: What is your opinion on the java ecosystem?

Java used in tons of places
Personall not into the syntax and vibes

However, always Java Jobs
Koitlin seems hot

hazeanderson: Java is great for projects that involve multiple teams that either

Just not for me

How do you read the python documentation how can I tell if the element is a
command or just an attribute

type
dir
