## Brand New Company

Coolgle

Cool Google
  - Not sell all your info
  - Not be a terrible Ad company

Co -> Like a pidgeon cooing -> caux

## 3 Year Long, make friends with Crows

- Crows will be your friend.....for a price
....once the bribes stopping flowing,
the respect stops

Pieces of tin foil
Give them to grows

Get some respect

(They won't always interact with your gifts and be grateful right away)
Leave the gift, come back later, they will have taken the gift.
and they'll remember it's you.

2 weeks of no gifts -> ignoring
  -> I was getting a colder response

fair weather friends
fare feather friends

## Viewer Questions

lucasfernsilva: Begin, why use python instead of powerBI? I`m in a dilemma here in my company, do you have any opnions on that?

lucasfernsilva: @isaiahvander I know that powerBi can work with python but, is there a reason to use just powerBI or just Python?

Who is going to be interacting with this data most:

- Thigns like Power BI are good for Business Intelligence people. More focused
  for their workflow.

  - Are the people who are going to interact with this data, do they know python?
  - Do they know Power BI?

Dumb Developer Mistake:

- I'm going to give these X (Business, Client, Marketing, Sales, Recruiting) a
  more powerful tool. With Python they can anything!
  ....Nope.....you want a specific tool just for their job often,
  that YOU are hands off with helping.

You make the BI people use Python, you just hired yourself for a new unpaid job:
  - Teaching the BI people Python
  - Maintaining and Debugging their python
