thanveershah: the whole world is using google and google related app. So a few
people not using this wont make a difference right, cuz they still gets
informations

Argument: You're not making a difference, whats the point???

The saddest argument heard in my entire.
If I believed that, I'd kill myself.

Do not let a company being big, and dominant in a space, make you think
it will always be that way.


I am Begin can guarantee that won't be true

Do you want to be someone who maintains the gross-evil status quo?
or do you want to work on building a new world.

If you don't watch Porn, you get better at programming.
Try it for 30 days,
compare it to your last 30 days
Bet you smarter than the previous

## Confessions

purplepinapples: sad that our current culture stresses money

beginbot: its cool, the majority people will never be happy
  will never acoomplish what they want
  always waiting.
  .....who cares, let them do it.
  people on twitter, mad alll day
  thats all they do
  ....not my job to help them
  ....you can't help anyone
  you can only help yourself
  and let your good actions,
  affect universal.

## Beliefs

- I beleive in 1 number: 1

- The single number -> moved from the 2 dimenison to 3 dimenisons
with the trinity: 0, 1, infinity

- I beleive there are infinite dimenisons:
- Scientists say: 26 dimenisons (cmon yall....just 26)

- Time -> is folded like a swiss cake roll

All things have happened, or are happening right now.
We can communicate through dimensions,
and this is what people call: "Signs", "Divine Intutition"


## Sound Cool

Replace the phrase: "Im going keep a 100 with you"
With:               "Ima keep it 2 Virgils with you"



## Quotes

sysosmaster: I am normal. I just Reject your reality and substitute my own....

## TODO

- You watch a movie or some Pron
  - you get a big ole hit of Dopamine
    Woooo!!!!!
  - you want more!!!

- When you take in less chunks of Dopamine,
you're more sensitive to Dopamine spikes.

You're programming, you solve a problem,
you get that Dopamine, and it's wonderful

....if you had gotten a giant spike.....that little programming
Dopamine not as good.....programming not fun.

Identify what releases Dopamine for you:

- Ask yourself, is this something, you want to chemically
  reenforce in your brain as something you want to keep doing???

you can addicted (in a fun) to programming

Anyone a speed-demon, thrill-seeking:

- you get into going fast....you only want faster.


You solve a problem, get a little high
fap -> get a big rush



....you just told you brain, this other activity gives the bigger rush:

- you get into going fast....you only want faster.


You solve a problem, get a little high
fap -> get a big rush

....you just told you brain, this other activity gives the bigger rush/

Youtube:

- Watch a vidoe -> get a hit
- Wathc another vidoe - get a hit
-...... you're body is now saying!!!!! Hey give more dopamine.
    and we know how to get it youtube!
    so you brain screams youtube now!!!!

you don't endulge in those things,
you fast from dopamine,
then you start getting smaller amounts from healthier
activieis, programming, working out reading.


....then you brain starts goiing: hey programming I want some dopamine!
hey workout I wanna get high!

How do you wake up early day: 6AM -> 6:15 AM, 3:30 -> go to gym, Read, meditate

What is routine:
  - Your brain releases chemicals at the same time.
