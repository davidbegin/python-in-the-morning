## Opinions

If you meet someone who pronounces lots of words "wrong",
they might be a actual person who learns and reads on their own.

....I don't look up how to pronounce words, until I have to pronounce then.

If someone mispronounces a word, it means a risk taker
because they are using words, they haven't heard other people say,
but they've learned through reading or other things.

....other dorks.....are too afraid to try and pronounce a word,
they are unsure

detlion1643: i get irked at people who can't use past tense correctly... like eat/eated instead of eat/ate... or ones who can't pronounce "ed" correctly like kilt instead of killed :(

Some languages don't have all these tenses

you can full latin, and have 36 chambers of tenses.
....does it make it things more clear.

if you are annoyed its proving you understand the sentence,
because theres dissonance between what they said and interruption.
