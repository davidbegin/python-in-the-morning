daveddev: International Crimes of Used Patterns ICUP

- Punish communities for confusing the language around Patterns:

- Rails  -> ActiveRecord
- Python -> Decorator
- Ruby   -> Hash
- Rust   -> Builder Pattern

daveddev: factory pattern definition has been distended. a function that returns a type is not a factory. originally, it was a function that returns a variable type (one of multiple implementations of an interface).

Factory -> Yo I make objects for you, but of several types, but
            they all got stuff in common.

It ain't a Factory if it always produces the same Type?

I've seen whats called a Factory Pattern, be abstractions around
complicated constructors.

Pivot: Make a zine

## Power Rankings

- Rust
- Elixir
- Go

- Crystal
- Haskell
  - The most mind-bending
- Zig (competes with C)
  - https://ziglang.org/
- Nim <- Looking for a Evangelist to sell me
- https://github.com/hylang/hy
- https://dlang.org/
- Dart <- Need a little more selling
- Kotlin <- All the Java nerds seem to love it.
            if you're doing android, seems like the
            hot option these days.

            I want to meet someone who switched Kotlin,
            not from Java.

shineslove: im trying to learn it still (Nim)

codeshow: D- Lang is powerful, it has Universal Function Calls and that feature is amazing

strager: @CodeShow C has universal call syntax :)

strager: Universal call syntax: if you can write obj.method(args), then you can write method(obj, args)
strager: and vice versa

daveddev: class-based inheritance compromises isolation
and complicates types due to taxanomic hierarchy

it's leaky and makes the types confusing

## Interview Question:

You hear the meme "Composition over Inheritance", when do you choose inheritance?

- Shallow, not multiple levels
- All children that inherit, to use all of the methods inhertied
- Shallow and wide, lots of subclasses using everything, but only one level.
- What is shared in parent class for state

## Code Sabbath

- NO WORK
- Learning is greatly encouraged
- Celebrate and Worship the Code
- Talk to about Code and Life
- Read from Ancient Texts
  - 6 years

## Viewer Questions

Can you make a website that is a good experience on the Phone first.

faolan437: i have finally got a project that i can work on. It will be used on IOS android and web. What would be the best language to work well on all three?
faolan437: i have been reading alot and it says start web app then convert to mobile

- Vue Website
- Start with a React Web App
  - Then Try React Native
- Flutter
  - Beginbot: No Experience
- Ionic -> Angular

How complex is the application:
  - So many mobile apps, will NEED To written natively.

Whats the future maintenance of this project?

React doesn't sound like a bad option.



beldathas: Do you recommend the approach of learning design patterns ? I
remember having a course on that back in Uni and the teacher was so terrible so
I didn't learn much demLewd

Design Patterns can be useful
It's useful for unified language
Often Established patterns for problems are established for a reason
However, like any tool they can used in every place incorrectly

The Problem With Learn Design Patterns:

- You learn a pattern in a simplified not useful case,
  - then a specific use case
  - you never learn where to use them.

- When you learn a design pattern, you have to spend more time,
  with a single pattern, to get it into your toolbox.
  You should look at a particular pattern in the Wild (Open Source)

- I think it's silly to rip through 10 design patterns
  unless you are treating as a tour, or what is out there.
  then when you have a problem, try to think through,
  which

uforek: rust is for masochistic programmers, can we be honest?
beginbot: what happened???
beginbot: what lang you come from?
beginbot: whatd try and build

## TODO

daveddev: complicated construction is still just construction. variable construction involves special placement within a program in combination with special definitions beyond the construction func. (i.e. an interface define and implemented)

## Split Philosphy

- Vim Splits
  -> when you're in one project, editing!!! editing!!!
- Tmux Splits
  -> When you are runnign muliple projects, or editing one side,
    and running something on the other.
- I3 Splits
  -> Separate Programs, or programs that launch other programs
