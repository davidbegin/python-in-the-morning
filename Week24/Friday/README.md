olabaz: what is config file drift

We have 20 servers:
  - We write a script to run on those servers to install things
    - Run on each of the 20 servers install stuff
  - We write an update script and it updates some stuff
  - Then we discover, that 1/20 servers, crashed, and didn't
    get the update.
  - Our configuration!
  - You run script and it doesn't update, so you append to say,
    if its crashed boot it up, then update it.
  - Eventually you end up while a giant pile of scripts,
    checking the state of infrastructure, to know how
    to apply and how to keep in sync.
  - This state is calculated each time.

Terraform or cloud Formation
  - I want the final infratsturuce to look like X:
  - Terraform or CLoudformation, or just a state machine
    looking at you current infra, looking at it's know 
    saved state. And then it produces a diff of what to run.
    And the diff, (AWS, GCP, Azure), that diff results
    in a bunch API calls, in a specific order.

## Gamer Plan

- Enroll in a Nightclasses for Fortnite
  - Get certied in building up level 3
  - Then I would do training exercises a month
- you might able to buy the game and start playing

Total Cost: $5000 for the month certification, to get access to Fortnite, CODo
Paid $250 I got 100 Question Assessment:
- build certification course, that tailored to my gaps in knowledge.

3 LoL Certs, they said i'd be set for life.  2 years.


## Fun Project

- Automate looking for uncertified gamers, and automatically report..

### Long Term Goal

- change the rules of Twitch, so it's a requirement you display
valid links to all of your Up to date Gamer Certs and Credentials

- bot that requires the certs to be linked

## Gamer in Training Talk

- if you want companies to stop ripping you off,
  you have to stop ripping yourself off.
  ....if everyone buys the game and the DLC
  ....and it works.....then they are going
  to keep doing it.
  If you release a thousand scarfs you can buy
  for money, and yall wont stop buying them,
  then you just created a scarf company.

  PS1
  PS2
  PS3
  PS3
  PS5 -> 10 years to get the PS5
         then 10 years gaming on the PS5 to hit senior gamer

  GTA1 -> $500

Does anyone have PHD in Starcraft:
  - Stable career, tenure in Starcraft
  - Political nightmare

## Learnings

## Ponderings

Realtime applications have operational deadlines between some triggering event and the application's response to that event.

I never knew the definition of real-time.
This means as long as we are within our operational deadlines,
then something is real time.

programmers use realtime operating systems (RTOS) on which the maximum response time can be calculated or measured reliably for the given application and environment. A typical RTOS uses priorities. The highest priority task wanting the CPU always gets the CPU within a fixed amount of time after the event waking the task has taken place.

Why do I want this

## How innovation happens

You automate some game, and beat your friends HS:

2 Paths in the Road:

- Path 1: Tell them you used technology.
    You feel like a hotshot, and maybe they get
    interested in tech also! .....they will definitely
    not play that game anymore. Chances on them getting
    into tech from this: 0.3%
- Path 2 (Choosen Path): You don't tell them. You saw
  bejewelled blitz isn't that hard. ...... They will
  push themselves, you could literally create a world
  class bejewelled blitz.

## Experiences

## TDD Thoughts for New Cult Members

- Really be literal about the rules, and rigid, and try to
  fend off the expectations.

When learning TDD, GO TOO FAR.
How do you learn when it's too many tests.......you write too many tests.

It's easier to help someone writing too many tests, starting focusing
on a smaller higher quality set of tests, than getting some to test more.

It's real impossible to simply teach someone, how much testing is too much,
that is a lifelong skill, craft we're working on.

Junior vs Senior

Senior:
  - When to test, when to not
  - When gold plate, when to duct tape
  - When optimize, when run and hide

Gold Plate -> (Over) Polishing.
  - When to actually "premature" optimize

In general when learning, I think you should overuse a technique, and then
start developing the sense, knowledge experience, to know when to back off.

Are we Bikeshedding ->
  -> You're worry about the color of the bike shed,
      arguring over that, instead of the larger
      more important ideas.

Are we Shaving Yaks ->
  -> Fragile Tests,
      update code,
      update all the tests
      update code
      update all tests

## GPT3 Statement

ladka8: Things like the GPT-3 API scare me and demotivate me :(
beginbot: THIS IS SILLY

- All my friends who programmer aren't scared or think it's
an insane game changer

- Everyone who is learning to program, is freaking out.

- People think that programming is like this smart, perfect, organized task,
that we all do, and use our brains, and make good decions

....its a shitshow.
punchypenguin: Hahahaha
erikdotdev: it's controlled chaos

## Learning to Program Advice

- When you hear some opinions, find out who that person is.
  Theres circles on the internet, people who don't program
  for a living, talking about how X is going to change
  programming for a living.

How to break into software at your current job:

- Look for your own problems and solve them.


## Ticket Sizing Rant

- Establish the time spent, to accuacy of estimate.

## Video Idea

- Every single company, that will replace
  devs with business people!

GPT3 SQL Example

SQL was supposed to get rid of Devs
Structrued Query Language, where you get whatever you need
out of it.

ladka8: If anything SAP only gave programmers more jobs
punchypenguin: When the internet came out it was suppose to close down the libraries, but mind is still kickin
celebrimborfan123: the problem with the "replace dev" stuff is that requires vendor lock in and any good dev knows that's an awful idea
punchypenguin: They had to integrate though
erikdotdev: Also the industry evolves. If that AI existed 25 years ago. It wouldn't know how to write a webpage. 15 Years ago it wouldn't know anything about writing Mobile apps or IoT., or write code that could manage the amount of data we produce now.

Introduce Salesforce to get of devs:
- hire devs to customize salesforce
- hire more devs to build extra features to salesforce
- you're at square 1

Sales teams are going to use Salesforce, I'm not
going to stop them.....but I am not going to pretend
it's making my job easier.

If you create some program that will replace devs,
it has to be to totally and utterly customizable,
