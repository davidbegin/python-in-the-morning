## Stuck with a Problem

- Search Engine of Choice
- The official docs
- Stack Overflow (read everything)
- Blog Posts

2 Ways:

- Spaghetti at Wall <- Just try and experiment, until ti works 
  often needed for stuff no documention, no SO, no help!
- Read it all <- read the full docs, ALL of them. Even if you don't
                 understand why you learning


Spiking

Lets see if our idea is going to work:
  - Make a demo
  - Find the rough areas
  - The code (hopefully will be throw out)
  - Alot of times it's Time-Boxed:
    - Lets give you 2 days, to see how far you can get:
      -  you can answer the question, should we keep going
          down this route.

## The Spike Conundrum

- Spikes are SUPPOSED TO BE thrown out
- They rarely are
- So now programmers know this, and the code as if it's NOT A spike,
  increase the impact of the Sunk Cost Fallacy on their Managers,
  leading to a higher like-hood, it won't throw out.
  Re-enforcing the Forever Kept Spike Problem

## Begin Strategy To Make Sure Spike don't Live

- Write the WORST CODE EVER
- DON'T DOCUMENT ANYTHING
- DON'T TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOUR DOING

## Learning Vim

- Learning Vim with something else you Don't know
  - new programming language
  - new framework
  - new paradigm
  - You want to make it so you are typing SLOW, because you don't know
    what to type
- Vim Journal
  - Vim is overwhelming
  - You don't learn it all at once
  - Work on a couple things at a time
  - Vim is Physical
    - It's like playing a sport
    - or an instrumetn
    - you don't just learn a hotspin move and then use it game.
    - you master the spin move
    - you don't just learn a hot Marimba lick
       and then challenge teej to first chair competetion
       you play the lick a lot.
       Then it's second nature. Then you add more.

    - You have different levels of use:
      - Not Knowing
      - Knowing but never using
      - Knowing and using occasionally
      - Maximimum Fluidity
  - write down all the things that frustrate you,
    but don't stop and fix them all.
    but keep track
  - You got a big list of things you don't know in Vim.
  - Code Sabbath Day: Organize the list, pick the thing you find yourself
    wawnting to do the most often. And learn how to make that better.
  - You start customizing your vim, when you want to you, and when it's fun for
    you. For me, that was right away.

## Viewer Questions

lucasfernsilva: Begin I really need to ask you this, I`m getting much better at
designing but my code keeps getting bigger, I started a project for the company
I work and just the simple verifications(if, elif, errors returns) I had like
300 lines, how can I get my code smaller ? (it`s very readable by the way)

Beginbot: Small IS NOT THE GOAL:
  - Maintainability (in portion to the maintenance needed) is more important.

- Most Loved Electron App:
  - Discord (Mix)
  - VSCode (Mostly love except from vimmers)
  - Spotify (No love, but no hate)
  - Slack (Begin/Stupac hateeeeeees it)
  - Skype (Begin didn't know people liked this)

## Interview Advice if your Nervous and Ya New

- Don't be afraid to say you don't know something,
  but then break down your initial thoughts and plans
  for getting the info

Bad Interview Who watches too Much Scam Programming Youtube:
  - Interviewer asks "How would you handle X?"
  - Wrong Way: Just Go for it, just bullshit, maybe ill be a right
    maybe I remember the answer. If I just guess right, I'll have
    hacked the interview, and they won't know I'm dumb.

  - Interviewer: oh you trying to bullshit me, that would be really annoying
    to work with. Versus:

## Confessions

- I am intimidated by these group buys:
  - What the heck am I buying???
  - I look at all the different variations and it scares me
  - Jeff has messed me up bad, and I get real nervous about waiting
    months for something.

## Quotes

The Gervais Principle is this:

Sociopaths, in their own best interests, knowingly promote over-performing losers into middle-management, groom under-performing losers into sociopaths, and leave the average bare-minimum-effort losers to fend for themselves.
