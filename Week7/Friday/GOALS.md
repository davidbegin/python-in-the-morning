Goals
-----

Everytime a user posts, post their soundeffect options
give a user a new soundeffect

Where are the list of effects?

Create the sound game:

Everyone starts with 5 Sounds:

- Everyone starts with the same sounds
- Everyone starts with random sounds

- Every X minutes a random person gets a sound,
  they get to choose 2 other people to give the sound to.

- Everytime someone uses a sound effectively, begin or others can vote to say
  so, giving them more of a chance of getting choosen in the future.

When that person uses a sound to great affect, they will get points
and get access to more sounds

When people vote to have people remove
