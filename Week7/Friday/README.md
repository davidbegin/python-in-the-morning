Hang out with people who you have no idea what
their talking about, and just a absorb things

There is no such thing as good and bad
Programming is as big the universe

What is a unit-test?

Begin co-opted Definition:

- if the test fails, you know what method the bug is in

What's the point of writing tests?????
- find problems quickly

- make money, by saving time
- How do you make money from tests?
  - They fail and catch something that would have cost you example
  - It points you quickly to a bug

- writing test that will never fail is a bad investment

Only test public methods!
private is implementation and can change

## Problem

How do we reward people for their excellent use of soundeffect
How to punish people for not using them right.

## Idea

Every time a user posts, post their soundeffect options
give a user a new soundeffect

Where are the list of effects?

Create the sound game:

Everyone starts with 5 Sounds:

- Everyone starts with the same sounds
- Everyone starts with random sounds

- Every X minutes a random person gets a sound,
  they get to choose 2 other people to give the sound to.

- Everytime someone uses a sound effectively, begin or others can vote to say
  so, giving them more of a chance of getting choosen in the future.

When that person uses a sound to great affect, they will get points
and get access to more sounds

When people vote to have people remove
