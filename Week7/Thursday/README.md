## Viewer Questions

whatsinmyopsec: yo the python requests library sucks for contents it doesn't
return everything in ""

whatsinmyopsec: so for values like true false and null they don't get "" which
is annoying because thats not supposed to happen

it's converting "true" true

So !uhoh is a sound with a YT ID and if I set uhoh to be a different ID, can you save the original uhoh YT ID and time segment. Similar to how you'd save past addresses in a customer DB

People when learning are way too quick to grab libraries, and just
rotate them until they work.

You end up learning up libraries, and not the fundamental concept you want.

Better build your own with the basic stdlibs, after you're getting real annoyed
and it's working, and you more focused on your projects domain, then look
at the libraies, with your new knowledge.
