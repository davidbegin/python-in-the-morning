Turning Python, FFMPEG, and ImageMagick into randomly generated Music Videos

## Life Goals

Master these libraries

- youtube-dl
- ImageMagick
- FFMPEG

## Demo

soundaffects:

- `<leader>oa` -> menu of labor
- `<leader>os` -> noememe

- `<leader>wl` -> whitelist the user under the cursor
- `<leader>bl` -> blacklist the user under the cursor

Goodmorning its yaboi, begin lets have some fun ha aww

ArtMatt only has the !snorlax command

Gifs:

- so idk
- so jdk

How do we add Gifs and how do we add Soundaffects

All we need is a youtube link

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnPGGDWQMqk

hook at twitch chat
to automatically add soundaffects

Security Measures:
- Restrict to small set of users
- Restrict to length of the clip

dougthecoder: How about these tiers: "Rabble, Riff-raff, Regulars, Royalty" LUL

## Ponderings

New to programming, want to stream and program

What are you goals:

- Learn
- Going a Twitch Stream
- Get a Job
- Have Fun

Don't worry about trolls on twitch, if they troll they troll and will move on,
just keep doing what you're doing.

It's less important what you do, more just doing it.

Coding Twitch Problem:

- Too much worrying about what, just do it, and see where it goes.
It will evolve, and you don't know how you're gonna work on stream.

My streaming work style is different than workstyle.

## Experience

OBS and Websockets:

On Mac, I could run, however, after a certain number, 10ish events triggered
OBS would freeze would have to restart.

Arch OBS and OBS-Websockets and it crashed everytime I sent an invalid
command, for instance trying to choose a scene didn't exist.

I installed the dev-version of websockets plugin, no problems!

youtube-dl:
dougthecoder: Future feature suggestion for clips: audio fade-in and fade-out :) https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/19867/how-to-fade-in-out-a-video-audio-clip-with-unknown-duration
artmattdank: ok so what is the syntax?
dougthecoder: @beginbot I have a simple method for enforcing time limit - run ffmpeg a 2nd time (after the user specified time clip) and clip from 0 seconds to (limit) seconds
kopimocha: have an idea for improvement, web socket to twitch redemption pubsub, use channel points and then do some automation to run adding new sound effect
