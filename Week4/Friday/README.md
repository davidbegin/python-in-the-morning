## Viewer Questions

in vim-or-tmux
*vivax3794:* one thing I want is "l" to act as enter in menus.  vivax3794: like
when using NERDtree, I want to be able to select a file by pressing l. since I
can navigate with j and k. and I feel like l is a natrual way to select a file.
vivax3794: I cant just map l to enter wither since that would screw up the
Standard vim keybindings, I guess I could use `<leader>l`. but I want a way
without leader.  vivax3794: is there a way to overwrite a key shortcut for only
one type of file?  vivax3795: (in vim)

myusernamefrank: @beginbot if you create MIDI files with mingus, I recommend
timidity to play it, has a high quality sound font

## TODO

hazeanderson: one thing on my plate is to write assembly code that generates a
square wave (or whatever is simplest) out the computers speakers

usernamesarelame: @new_duck we're gonna need more info than that..
elremingu: do you probably use a login manager?

```python
'chords', 'determine', 'interval_diff', 'intervals', 'notes',
'numeral_intervals', 'numerals', 'parse_string', 'range', 'six', 'skip',
'substitute', 'substitute_diminished_for_diminished',
'substitute_diminished_for_dominant', 'substitute_harmonic', 'subst`
