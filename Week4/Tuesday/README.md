## Challenges

ortvaobgobg: - st is crashing when I open it now

- fg vf penfuvat jura V bcra vg abj
- emoji font might needed
- for some reason when I J in vim, it crashed

## Twitch Chat Practice

```vimrc
send msg
<leader>tw

copy last 5 msgs
<leader>tr

search msgs
<leader>tu

Comman twitch chat commands
<leader>te

gist
normal mode <leader>gi

Bug in visual mode

```

One-Off alias
quick alias in vimrc
favorites, that always searvhes from

## Viewer Questions

quadran7: How do you help your teammates help themselves?

kinbiko: so stuff in ""s are literally those characters. brackets + | mean
either-or. full stop just means that it's the end of the definition, i.e.
it doesn't go on to a new line

usuallyhigh: Speaking of BNF and such, have you seen the built in python
module "tokenize"? It provides a lexical scanner for Python source code,
built in Python

## Questions

- What are good modern languages for
- numerical weather prediction
- finite element analysis
- computational fluid dynamics
- computational physics
- crystallography
- computational chemistry

- Did FORTRAN make more money than LISP?
  - Programmers being paid
- including extended Backus–Naur form (EBNF) and augmented Backus–Naur
form (ABNF). When do you need one of these?

- How do you become a grammarian?

- When would you FORTRAN VS COBOL or vice-versa?

## Learnings

Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable
applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid
clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and
declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable,
and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make
high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation seeks to drive adoption of this paradigm
by fostering and sustaining an ecosystem of open source, vendor-neutral
projects. We democratize state-of-the-art patterns to make these innovations
accessible for everyone.

- Is Cloud Native a standard?

Noam He also introduced a clear distinction between
generative rules (those of context-free grammars) and
transformation rules (1956).

The History of BNF:

- Panini invented his own BNF back in the day
- Then some langauge nerds AKA linguistics got interested
- Mathfriends got into it
- Then this moved into Comp Sci with Bachus

- <https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rewriting>

 the first widely used high-level programming language, and was the
inventor of the Backus–Naur form (BNF), a widely used notation to define
formal language syntax.

He later did research into the function-level programming paradigm,

presenting his findings in his influential 1977 Turing Award lecture "Can
Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?"

What are Context Free Grammers as opposed to other Grammers: - You can
determine if any string is valid according to the formal grammer -
Context-Full is when you need extra context to determine if a string is
valid

## Ponderings

I need to explore Other Window Managers:

- bswspwn
- qtile
- develop a deeper a relationship with I3

We should all be learning, math, comp sci and Linguistics

<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini>

It is a popular language for high-performance computing[4] and
is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.

- Should we be trying to break into these industrieis with a new lang

## Opinions

- Products and Companies
- Humans

- By Friday - Have all my emotes submitted

hazeanderson: you get like 25 hazeanderson: it's a browser
extension, like BTTV, that renders things like FeelsGoodMan into
emotes hazeanderson: you can associate your Twitch account with
FrankerFaceZ and get 25 emotes -- sure you are being tracked by
FrankerZ but he is omnipotent ruler of Twitch and no harm surely
will come about from using a free service that uses your creds
:tf: hazeanderson: (pretty sure it's safe dude)
