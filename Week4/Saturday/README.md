3nkido: What's the difference between clojure and curry

stupac62: @beginbot Zack is i like identity matrix for matrix math?
Zach: I imagine so???
      when you multiply the identity by the any matrix do you get the same
      Matrix?

myusernamefrank: are there Haskell cons, too?

- Confusing
- Math is a goverment conspiracy
- Unfamiliar to traditional programmers
- Some of us can't grow beards

More specific the type === more gaurentinees
Begin THinks: I NEED THOSE GUARANTINEE

## Questions

## Haskell Recap

Associative: Grouping don't matter
Commutative: the Order doesn't Matter
Abstract Alegbra: Meta-Math - Describes the interfaces of Math
Monoids - Interface

@NathanielBumppo Except exceptions, concurrency, and plenty of other ugly
details =]

## Learnings

Why is A is haskelly

Haskell monads and all the fun stuff like Just, Maybe, Nothing etc.
