## Viewer Questions

hanycodes: a little question of topic, do you recommend applying for a junior
job or better just to keep studying and later contribute to some open source
project ?

- Applying for jobs is a skill, you need to warm up
- Jobs don't care if you apply 3,6,9,12 months
- Interviewing helps you focus on what your lacking
- If you want a job, apply early and often
- Being nervous is awesome!
  - You will be nervous, until you do 5 in a row
  - Then that 5th you'll be killing it
  - I have no degree, self taught, got fulltime
- Be honest with what you are looking for:
  - I want to do X type of work
  - This is the mentorship I want
  - Look for the match between both your needs
- You find a junior job and jsut take the first one,
  and its not the right role, company, no mentors
- Better to get rejected a bunch, wait, find a company
  who can mentor you.
- Your first junior job, you learn EVERYTHING ON THE JOB.
