## Viewer Questions

sweeku: Hey @beginbot , can you help me wrap my head around how a amazon
ec2/lambda/pipeline, a CI/CD, and a orchestration tool like cron/airflow/luigi
interact with each other. How do I call my webscraper script?

LAMBDA ETL PIPELINE

CI/CD Tools in Amazon: Codebuild/CodeDeploy -> This wants your whole life to be
AWS

Github Actions, Jenkins, Your own thing, Travis, Circle,

Docker Containers -> Fargete, simplest, least control, still starting with
Docker, and you can move to more customizable things

Step-Functions in Lambda for Serverless Orchestration

Whats is like interviewing people:
- Akward
- Hard
- Some sort of weird game

You are doing process, where you are asking poeple questions/talking to them
to figure if they can do somethign different

its the equivlent, to asking a baseball how they would handle a fastball,
versus watching them pitch.

It's a guessing game
It's a betting game
