zanuss: Is there a tool I should be using OR setup that I should have to update

Local -> Write migration column for new column
Merge into master
Have those migrations run.

## Confessions

and improving. Don't try and control the stream.

## TODO

docd27: btw if instead of using postprocessor-args you run youtube-dl -g and get
the m3u url out, you can then run ffmpeg -ss -t against that, and it *will* just
download the specific hlsl/dash segments for that timestamp instead of the whole
video. Don't ask me why youtube-dl doesn't do that out of the box, there's an
active bug report for this issue

disk1of5: @beginbot can i add a todo to your list.... add 5 second clip fromt he
music generator you made !musicai seed command_name

figure out the fuzzy problem
