    then it will be triggered

## Viewer Suggestions

- WE MUST PROTECT THE IDENTITY OF REVOLUTATIONAIRES
- ....secret sound command????
- ....beginbot must provide a way for groups to be able to organize and vote
- ....viewers should be able to form a party and if they get into power,
- ....then they make the rules.
- ....JSON Constitution
- ....Viewers should be able to write a JSON Constitution
- ....Which we will validate, which will dictate rules
- ....   - When street cred drops, sound limits, health limits

## Viewer Questions

blueredbrackets: what location is the background?
beginbot: DDGed free wallpaper sunset

fiveshot97: How are you able to navigate through files so easily?

beginbot advice: dedicate time when programming, when you don't
need to hit deadline, and make a habit of writing down
all the things that are slowing you down, you wish you knew how
to do.

## Questions

## Learnings

## Ponderings

Hack the Box makes me a little uncomfortable:

- in the same way, doing a "big" project from a book, or blog series,
  or set of videos, is that helpful.

if you trying to learn: don't just do something else someone layed out for you.
The hard part is directed.

It's ok to have packages:

- Packages should go through code review.
- Ruby Theory: if something didn't past code-review, you could wrap it in a
  GEM and resubmit it.
- If code fails code review, hide is in a package and NO ONE WILL CARE.

It is not cool being on top, it's cool knowing how to get on top
