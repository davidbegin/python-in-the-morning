- Learning to code is fun
- It does take time, and you fail a bunch
- You don't need to pay a dollar
  - Often paying, is paying for a slower to learn
- Fastest way to learn, real project

- Fastest way to get paid at programming, is to focus
  on getting paid, no matter how little at programming

- Simple Dumb Sites
  -> Adding a Paypal to a Rails site
  -> fix our Login
  -> We want to store photos
  -> we want a site

If you don't focus on getting paid, YOU HAVE TO QUIT
->

It all depends, I like to work at small startups, and its
a wacky ole time.

Startup
  -> I can do whatever I want! ....as long as I'm working....like always
Corporation
  -> Can't do whatev, but you don't have to be on the clock after 5 on weekends

There are tons of jobs out there for you
What's most important, finding what you find
interesting, and a team, that will support
your style.

Your Style:
  -> I like to collaborate, pair programming, mob programming, chit-chatting
  -> I program because I understand computers and not humans, stay away from

If Life was a game Civilization (Sid Meyers), he would be a character
I read Ashlee Vance on Elon, and it made me tired

People Love Teslas

I like Elon going for broke, waaaay more than
someone just talking about shit
