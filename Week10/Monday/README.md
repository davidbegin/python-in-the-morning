- you submitted a twitch command, that saved a youtube url and some info
in a JSON

- Then a bot read from the file, and looked for approved messages
- Downloaded the soundeffect from youtube, and made it available for Robin

## Confessions

usuallyhigh: You went from man to child again
usuallyhigh: Should have let your beard grow until quarantine is over

beginbot: it hit me, everyone is using this an excuse to grow out a beard.
just do the opposite.
I'm going to shave every single morning/night

## Advice

If you find a trend everyone is doing, just do the opposite

If you haven't started streaming, but want to, you better start now,
so you can get those crashes out of the way. You wanna be really good and
things going wrong, which you only gain experience from real life doing it.

Don't let stuff hold you back
You suck at streaming at first

Beginbot: It's better to suck while you stuff sucks

zeeb__: DONT PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR VIEWER COUNT AND SUBS ETC
zeeb__: strem because you want to and have fun

beginbot stream goal: have fun not stress.

hard getting started
harder to keep going

you got to stream to no people
to crashes

why does beginbot stream: social fun coding exploration nerd time.
