Python is Slow

build things fast, the code is slower
take more time, and build something fast

Programming is an insanely giant field

There can be 2 experts, who think the other is a complete idiot

## Advice

Important things to consider when starting programming:

- Find a fun community you are excited about
- Programming is huge, is you don't like something, theres
  so much more out there.
- Having a good squad can really speed up your learning,
  while making it more fun
- Don't be too scared of going down the wrong path
  As programmers, thats the whole the game
  You will spend weeks working on something,
  ....and then realize it's all wasted time.

- You learn some Micro Python, you building stuff,
  keep going until you hit some program micro python
  can't handle. Then you reach for C, etc.

detlion1643: i have a different opinion, example of your scaling... building
your bot with tinydb for now, cool... but what happens when you need to retrofit
a real database back into it, and then retrofit a scaling database into that....

Premature Optimization is the Root of All Evil.
