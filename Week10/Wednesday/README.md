## Opinions

## Debates

## Rants

People wanting to pretend something is helping with something
...versus its fun

You can say, hey video games help problem solve, so im not procrasatinating
I'm still working on programming

Versus
hey I want to take break and have some fun

I don't take sick days at work
I take off days -> mental health

disk1of5: @beginbot what about a game like a flight sim that makes you a better
pilot..? or sim city that would make you better or think different at city
planning?

- Who would know more about building cities after a year:
  - City builder apprentice
  - Simcity Pro

Udemy -> If you finish a course it probably didn't work

Going through courses isn't hard, plotting your own course, and
knowing when to pivot, when to rabbit hole, when to ignore
is the real skill.

Learning is overwhelming
You don't need to learn the right things
You need to Learn:

- How to Learn
- How to find what to learn

I'm passionate you don't learn things, unless its "Real",
Real users
Someone using it
The hard part of programming, is the real world

Trick -> Open source something no one uses.

## How Find an Open Source Project

- Every project you end up on Github/lab/etc
  - Slow down, become a participant in Open Source
  - Read the documentation (Look for mistakes)
  - Check the issues
  - Check the pull requests

- You'll find some docs out of date, or wrong

- You'll find a bug, that is affecting you
  - boom you will recreate and provide more info

Playing in a band once a Week
