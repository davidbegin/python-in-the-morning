Hello subscribers, I value your input, sooo....

Idea for introducing JS:

Mario Cart Inspired 3...uh 4 Tracks:
  25  Lines
  50 Lines
  100 Lines
  250 Lines

Vanilla JS only
Code Reviewed on Stream

Random Ideas:

- When you vote for it, you get the option of turning it on your page??
- Or People Can Buy it For their Page
  - The More People Buy The More You Get Something????

I think I like the idea of people buying widgets from other users.
But maybe we can update the idea of buy, and instead make it
just a continuous endorsement, and the creator gets something extra???

I want to encourage people to write interesting/useful things with minimal JS,
and potentially figure out how to make it useful for other users (a very
important programming skill)
