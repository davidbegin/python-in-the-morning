## Storytime

I started streaming Coding in Septemeber 2019
Before working at startup, get into office at 6:15
3:30 -> morning routine
Bike to Gym Workout shower
3 Years
office 6:15AM

6:30
7:00
Friends Coworkers would come in!
And we'd hang out, talk about code, philosophy, history
9:00

.....the early crew broke apart
.....I was in the office for 3 hours alone
.....coding away lonely
.....I miss hanging out with a squad

September: Streaming at 6AM

I want to push an alternative narrative
Good Coders can go sleep on time and wake early
and that often IS Better than the all night hackathon

There is no such thing as an earlybird, or night-owl

I was a "nightowl", until I flipped int., until I flipped int.

YOU CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING ABOUT YOURSELF IN TERMS OF ACTION

September: -> Fluent Python
-> No Watches for like Months

Begin Stress Disease

I don't learn, or make "progress" daily, I get depressed and anxious
Some call this type "A".

If you want to do more work that your work, but you wait until after work
than at work you dreading the more work all day.

....versus Wake up early before the job, do something to make ya life better
go to he job
get off
NOW YOU DON'T GET TO WORRY ABOUT WORKING MORE AFTER WORK

2 Types of People:

- Begintype: natural driven and stessed
- Othertype: naturally chill and looking for direction

I found our Lords and Saviors 1 and 0s around 25
Shitty jobs
failed musician
lots of jobs

## Why Dolophins

Idiots think Dolphins are smart
They aren't smart
they are just horny
Dolphins are the Bros of the Sea

Crows are smart
Cats are Smart
Octopuses are Smart

- If you buy a protection -> Cool Points, Street Cred
  if someone tries to steal, you lose mana and the protection
  but keep you sounds

I streamed, I WAS SLOW AS HECK.....WHO CARES
month I never want to switch

Coding on Twitch very smoll
It makes no sense that I can't just find at least 1 streaming streaming in every
"major" language

Things that are missing on Twitch:

- More Languages
  - Elixir Stream
  - Crystal
  - Ruby Stream
  - OR Another Python Stream
- More people at all levels
  - Brand New
  - Junior
  - Everyone Else
- Different Styles
  - Freeform this is just my work
  - Coding FOR Twitch -> Waht I do, things for the stream to interact with
  - Planned out Curriculum

## History

tinkernthink: Emperor Caligula declared war on Poseidon. He ordered his soldiers
to march to the sea and stab the waves. After declaring victory, he proclaimed
himself a god more powerful than Poseidon, and ordered his soldiers to collect a
treasure chest of worthless seashells as proof.
