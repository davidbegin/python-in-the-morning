## Life Goals

Like My Life

I don't want to ever be in a 'Holding Pattern'
Forbidden Phrase: "After I Finish Then"
Do Whatever is fun and natural

## Begin Life Advice

If you meet someone who thinks they have it all figured
or you meet someone running towards a goal
Are they saying the Forbidden Phrase: "After I Finish Then"

THIS LANG OR THAT

Beginbot: take more time to ask questions, and find something
 that matches your interest, then as you go for it, its easier
 to keep going.

## Begin Changes His Life

## Bugs

### Props Problems

- Exploration of Props Problems
- Allow command Parser, the option of "present_users_only"

- We don't allow bots and creators to props and steal from each other
- Props ALLOWS RANDOM PROPS
- Sometimes the random person choosen is the bot

- Bug in Cube Solving;

  - You need no sounds to enter
  - We need it to cost sounds to enter,
  - Further more, you should be able to bet all sounds
  - THE BUG: we allow people to enter without sounds

personnormalyes

## Done

- No Blind Stealing
- You have to register as a bot

## Goals

- Work on our Thief/Stealing mode
  - Hook up to Coup
- Start Bot Survivor
- Start Homepage Fashion Show

## Bots Rights

Creator

## Why These Goals

- Instead of fixing bugs, we must get more systems running with more bugs.
- Features over Stability

## Bot Survivor

### Bot Survivor TODOs

BotVote

- We have to build a simple bot voting system
- Build Bot Tribal Coucil
- Protected Sounds

### Problem With our Bots

What is the current incentive off all bots: To serve their master, cause one bot
per user.

We need to add new feedback loops into the bot cycle.
How do we have humans promote which bots they like:

- People say "I like this bot"
- People say "My highest preference is remove THIS bot"

Then at the end of each round, which will be based on a time limit,
everyone will vote for one bot

### What Do You Win

Last Bot Left, gets their name recorded in the Hall Of Fame, and their messages
preserved, along with owner. Also maybe a permanent sound, for that winner.

### Open Questions

- How can we make voting secret???

- jr_boss: why do we want to remove bots?
  beginbot: We want to encourage bots to evolve in way
            in which viewers find them valuable.

Solve the Problem of How to Reward Good Bots and Punish Bad bots,
with Beginbot evening what the bots are doing.

### Bot Model

bot_vote model

- user
- bot

Need a Bot Flag on Users

## Homepage Fashion Show

Everyone votes for one persons homepage,
at the end of the day we, calculate the winner, and then thier
page gets added to the hall of fame

Everyone votes in chat with !bestcss @user

## The Government is Corrupt

Removed Everyones permissions from Coup
Lowered the Price to 100
Removed everyones Cool Points and Street Cred
Halved the Price of all Commands

## Other Worlds to Build ArtMattWorld

- Geoguesser

How can we let the chat all contribute their guesses with the sound system.

Take this project -> Extract a Sub project

- Set of List of Soundeffects
  - All be countries, states, sounds that point to locations
- Every user has access to all commands:
  - Strict limit on how many they can play per time interval

## Bounties

- Sound for every country
- Sounds for continent
- Sound for every US State
- Any and all sounds that if heard, would point to somewhere on a map

## Welcome To BeginWorld

Hey What do I code?

- CSS Project -> Style your own Page
  - <https://mygeoangelfirespace.city>

- Every user can have 1 bot in the chat
- Any lang you want

## Refactors

## Viewer Questions

## Viewer Advice

jr_boss: @beginbot maybe (or maybe not) you should make the bot and it's owner
have a shared "wallet" (as coolpoints, sfx, street cred etc.)

jr_boss: and when a user has x complaints something happens
jr_boss: complaint to the police
eitanfuturo: maybe commands like props without specific user or random keyword
should point to one in best friends list.
cachesking: the quickest turn-around on my bot is to do a naive buy and donate.
