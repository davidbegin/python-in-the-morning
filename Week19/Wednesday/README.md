## Snorlax Issue

- Factor Cost of Item into ability to Steal

If you are rich you are easy to steal from
If you steal an item thats wortha a lot, you're rich
and now easily

unlucksmcgee: Chance of getting caught increases, everytime someone steals
(imitating the police being on high alert). Then it can slowly decrease over time

Sounds are property
All physical goods break down
lowering their cost
when you play sound, that's weardown

- I hate typing `isinstance`, and often find myself having to, in elif island

isstance

its about how you want to classify your data

Data that is homogenous in nature, stats for pokemon battles

Divide the stats, by whether your in Team Rocket or Not
We move that into a class, all of sudden, we are sneaking in isinstance checks
And it's us creating our own boundaries, and python, is having
deconstructing those boundaries.

Core Principal of this argument is Heterogenous is out there and we work with
it!!!! We don't have good deconstruction tools to help

Proposed Improvements:

- Readability
- Relibility

- Its different, it doesn't look like "deconstructing" does
in other langs I see

- __match__ method, to customize deconstrution
- @typing.sealed, to say all subclasses, must be defined in current module
  this helps types

- Rust and Scala were influences

The match and case keywords are proposed to be soft keywords, so that they are
recognized as keywords at the beginning of a match statement or case block
respectively, but are allowed to be used in other places as variable or argument
names.

How do you feel about soft-keywords?
Sounds annoying for static analysis

Essentially this is equivalent to a chain of if ... elif ... else statements.
Note that unlike for the previously proposed switch statement, the pre-computed
dispatch dictionary semantics does not apply here.

Name bindings made during a successful pattern match outlive the executed suite
and can be used after the match statement. This follows the logic of other
Python statements that can bind names, such as for loop and with statement. For
example:

## Learnings

Q: What is the differnece in statement and expression in python?

isidentical: "Anything that you can use as a lambda body is an expression" is
the best definition I saw out there aciduk: my understanding was that an
expression returned a value, but that might be a simplistic understanding

### A Proper Pep

- Data on why this would be useful

## RURI

- What does it spell when you solve
- Can you do ZZ method and more letters?

## Bugs

- Bots can prop owners
- You can steal from yourself

### Props Problems

- Exploration of Props Problems
- Allow command Parser, the option of "present_users_only"

- We don't allow bots and creators to props and steal from each other
- Props ALLOWS RANDOM PROPS
- Sometimes the random person choosen is the bot

- Bug in Cube Solving;

  - You need no sounds to enter
  - We need it to cost sounds to enter,
  - Further more, you should be able to bet all sounds
  - THE BUG: we allow people to enter without sounds

Have you written a test with pytest???
Encapsulate the behavior you want with pytest
Then work

Look at this failing test, and code
how could I make this work

- Google made Go, and they were very disrespective to orignial go
  which now goes by golang
- Google made Go for large teams, Go has things about it at are useful

- Go is great for apps that need to do some concurrent operatio
