!insurance -> Cost Cool Points

## Good Ideas

mrsmoofy: I think you should do MD5 hash on the JS so that someone can't just
submits a copy of someone else's JS without "Buying" it from them

friendswithbeneficiaries: u know what

## How Does a Bot Gain Full Powers in Our System

Bots have limited powers
You enter in daily bot survivor
If you win
Then you get more powers???
(Maybe temp ban users)

Start of the Stream
Take the registers bots
Divde the 4 hours by the bots
That many automatic tribal councils

## Bot Survivor Concepts

We have a system for voting down bots
How do we then use it
Bots will be reentered, or have chance to recompete
This is to encourage better bot down bots
How do we then use it
Bots will be reentered, or have chance to recompete
This is to encourages

botvote

!insurance -> cost 2 Cool Points
if someone steals from you it blocks it
Then you have to buy more

## Bots

People Sponsor Bots:
  -> the more endorsements bots have, the more rights they unlock???
  People can vote for more than 1 bot

Voting a Bot off

nomorequity: @beginbot what about another casino game? Maybe the "!gamble
<cool_points>" command? Low chance of winning, winner takes all, losing points
go to jackpot prize

## Introducing JS

Limits to writing of the JS:

- Vanilla
- 25 Lines <- No Minified

Manually Approved (How can we get the people, to review and approve later on??
(Future Begin's Problem))
Once Approved, people can buy the "Widget" for their page
Buying is a permanent endorse of the Develop

Add Canvas object

### Why

To add JS for those who want JS
Give people practice making a super small product
Encourage creative within restrictions
Get some good thangs on peoples pages
Have JS to learn from.

## Priority

- Bot Survivor

## New Features

!insurance
-> Costs 1 Cool Points -> Protects from 1 Steal

!bestcss @user
-> Vote for the Styling of the Homepage

!stealing

### Next CSS Feature is voting on generic pages

- Bots
- Stats
- Individual Commands Page

## Bugs

stupac62: cuz you have to have enough to overtake the leader
stupac62: hot take: for ties, it goes to the person already in the lead
stupac62: cuz you have to have enough to overtake the leader

## Ideas

## Homepage Fashion Show

Everyone votes for one persons homepage,
at the end of the day we, calculate the winner, and then thier
page gets added to the hall of fame

Everyone votes in chat with !bestcss @user

## Adjusted Stealing

Instead of returning the chance of getting caught,
invert it to be chance of succeeding
instead a number (0.0 ... 1.0) (0 ... 100)

## Debates

## Early Code Streaming

More apologizing

If you gonna start code streaming, get out of the habit of apologizing

Lots of people have a fake idea of what programming looks like,
and I think as streamers you are apologizing for not be entertaining
and get up the myth of the hack god.

## Begin's Serious Not Serious Programming To Have Fun Programming

## Quotes

isidentical: PEP 622 has a very long way to go.
I don't really mind if it gets accepted, but not as is.
IMHO It needs major changes including very big simplifications.
It took like hours and hours to finally comprehend the whole document,
which I believe shows it is a very complex and dense piece of language
addition at least in a single transaction. It might be considered to divide the
PEP into parts and gradually include/exclude some parts of it. Let's wait and
see it

isidentical: By the way instead of raw globals, for 3.7+ code contextvars might
be useful depending on the architecture of the program

- Make a Changelog
- Write a catchy summary for the project description and the top of the README
- Looking into how to structure a Python project
- Instructions on How on to Run, and Requirements
- Python -> Thats a Snake -> Snake Case!
- PEP 8
- Don't divide code by things like class.
  - Its a life long learning process learning where code should go
- Look into __init__.py and using __all__
- Lists, dictionaries and List Comphrehesions
- You probably won't ever need to use Global in your first year of programming
  unless a library or framework specifically shows you
  mrsmoofy: Globals trigger me
  friendswithbeneficiaries: well when i try to edit global variables from inside
  a function it only edits local ones
  friendswithbeneficiaries: how do i work around that/
  -> YOU ARE ASKING FOR TROUBLE
  - functions should take arguments, and then modify whats passed
    or return a new copy with the updates you liked
- Theres a Cult out there you a going to meet when programming,
  who if you mention modifying state, they freak out.
  They are OBSESSED with never modify things are always building
  new things.
  WHY ARE THEY LIKE THIS????
