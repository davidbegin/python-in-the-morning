## How Does a Bot Gain Full Powers in Our System

Bots have limited powers
You enter in daily bot survivor
If you win
Then you get more powers???
(Maybe temp ban users)

Start of the Stream
Take the registers bots
Divde the 4 hours by the bots
That many automatic tribal councils

## Bot Survivor Concepts

We have a system for voting down bots
How do we then use it
Bots will be reentered, or have chance to recompete
This is to encourage better bot down bots
How do we then use it
Bots will be reentered, or have chance to recompete
This is to encourages

botvote

!insurance -> cost 2 Cool Points
if someone steals from you it blocks it
Then you have to buy more

## Bots

People Sponsor Bots:
  -> the more endorsements bots have, the more rights they unlock???
  People can vote for more than 1 bot

Voting a Bot off

nomorequity: @beginbot what about another casino game? Maybe the "!gamble
<cool_points>" command? Low chance of winning, winner takes all, losing points
go to jackpot prize

## Introducing JS

Limits to writing of the JS:

- Vanilla
- 25 Lines <- No Minified

Manually Approved (How can we get the people, to review and approve later on??
(Future Begin's Problem))
Once Approved, people can buy the "Widget" for their page
Buying is a permanent endorse of the Develop

Add Canvas object

### Why

To add JS for those who want JS
Give people practice making a super small product
Encourage creative within restrictions
Get some good thangs on peoples pages
Have JS to learn from.

## Priority

- Bot Survivor

## New Features

!insurance
-> Costs 1 Cool Points -> Protects from 1 Steal

!bestcss @user
-> Vote for the Styling of the Homepage

!stealing

### Next CSS Feature is voting on generic pages

- Bots
- Stats
- Individual Commands Page

## Bugs

- News
- bopojoe_: one big issue is that if you steal something you have, it takes it form
the other person and then theres one less in the economy

stupac62: cuz you have to have enough to overtake the leader
stupac62: hot take: for ties, it goes to the person already in the lead
stupac62: cuz you have to have enough to overtake the leader

## Ideas

-> We need more ways for to people to defend their property
tinkernthink: no mana for people in bunker
-> But you can't loose thiings
-> WE need punishments for being in bunker
-> You can only take sounds you own individually into the bunker
-> Once you are in the bunker, thsoe sounds will be cost will be halfved
  -> The Sounds will unavailable for others outside the bunker
  -> How do we make being in the bunker as valuable as being out of the bunker

zanuss: As an experiment make the insurance company spend their cool points
gained from purchased insurance to cover the stolen item. Allow them to go in
debt though.
zanuss: Would be cool to see if they made money or not

## Homepage Fashion Show

Everyone votes for one persons homepage,
at the end of the day we, calculate the winner, and then thier
page gets added to the hall of fame

Everyone votes in chat with !bestcss @user

## Adjusted Stealing

Instead of returning the chance of getting caught,
invert it to be chance of succeeding
instead a number (0.0 ... 1.0) (0 ... 100)

## Viewer Questions

stupac62: Do you start a project using cookiecutter template or just make the
folder contents yourself?
beginbot: When I know the best practices and Im in a flow of making dependenices
I do typically use a template.
But then other times, for fun, I just like to let things flow and evolve for
funsies.
Monolith -> microservices -> break into dependenices -> meta dependenices ->
combine back it back for a Monolith

dependency that pulls in 3 other:
Rpsec

stupac62: @beginbot are you going to ban iframes?

I would think of 'CaughtStealing' as a method/property of the User, yet you made
it an whole new class... Maintainability? Personal preference?

- Typically in any application, something becomes a "God" class
A lot of time in most applications, the User class is the first canidate
We are already suffering from this

The Logic for Caught Stealing is going to take in quite a few different
factors, outside of the user

if I start, using the victims wealth, or command cost, then I couple
those to the user

I from the scrool of thought, that make classes early and often when
you are building out some new concept, don't clutter the user class.
Later refactoring things might move around

Beginbot: ruby habits

If you take OO to the extreme, it becomes functional

## Begin Theories

- If Water tastes super good to you, then whatever activity you're doing
is probably
- If Fruit doesn't taste like a sugary explosion, Strawberries should be a
  sweet, maybe too sweet, otherwise you might have too much sugar in your life.
  - Fruit is a Dessert treat, eat it as a desert.

- Controling you ADHD -> NO drugs (except for what Dr. Dre)
- Journaling + Meditating
