## Life Goals

Like My Life

I don't want to ever be in a 'Holding Pattern'
Forbidden Phrase: "After I Finish Then"
Do Whatever is fun and natural

## Bugs

- You can steal from yourself

### Props Problems

- Exploration of Props Problems
- Allow command Parser, the option of "present_users_only"

- We don't allow bots and creators to props and steal from each other
- Props ALLOWS RANDOM PROPS
- Sometimes the random person choosen is the bot

- Bug in Cube Solving;

  - You need no sounds to enter
  - We need it to cost sounds to enter,
  - Further more, you should be able to bet all sounds
  - THE BUG: we allow people to enter without sounds

personnormalyes

## Done

- No Blind Stealing
- You have to register as a bot

## Goals

- Work on our Thief/Stealing mode
  - Hook up to Coup
- Start Bot Survivor
- Start Homepage Fashion Show

## Bots Rights

Creator

## Why These Goals

- Instead of fixing bugs, we must get more systems running with more bugs.
- Features over Stability

## Bot Survivor

### Bot Survivor TODOs

BotVote

- We have to build a simple bot voting system
- Build Bot Tribal Coucil
- Protected Sounds

### Problem With our Bots

What is the current incentive off all bots: To serve their master, cause one bot
per user.

We need to add new feedback loops into the bot cycle.
How do we have humans promote which bots they like:

- People say "I like this bot"
- People say "My highest preference is remove THIS bot"

Then at the end of each round, which will be based on a time limit,
everyone will vote for one bot

### What Do You Win

Last Bot Left, gets their name recorded in the Hall Of Fame, and their messages
preserved, along with owner. Also maybe a permanent sound, for that winner.

### Open Questions

- How can we make voting secret???

- jr_boss: why do we want to remove bots?
  beginbot: We want to encourage bots to evolve in way
            in which viewers find them valuable.

Solve the Problem of How to Reward Good Bots and Punish Bad bots,
with Beginbot evening what the bots are doing.

### Bot Model

bot_vote model

- user
- bot

Need a Bot Flag on Users

## Homepage Fashion Show

Everyone votes for one persons homepage,
at the end of the day we, calculate the winner, and then thier
page gets added to the hall of fame

Everyone votes in chat with !bestcss @user

## The Government is Corrupt

Removed Everyones permissions from Coup
Lowered the Price to 100
Removed everyones Cool Points and Street Cred
Halved the Price of all Commands

## Other Worlds to Build ArtMattWorld

- Geoguesser

How can we let the chat all contribute their guesses with the sound system.

Take this project -> Extract a Sub project

- Set of List of Soundeffects
  - All be countries, states, sounds that point to locations
- Every user has access to all commands:
  - Strict limit on how many they can play per time interval

## Bounties

- Sound for every country
- Sounds for continent
- Sound for every US State
- Any and all sounds that if heard, would point to somewhere on a map

## Welcome To BeginWorld

Hey What do I code?

- CSS Project -> Style your own Page
  - <https://mygeoangelfirespace.city>

- Every user can have 1 bot in the chat
- Any lang you want

## Chat Collective Consciousness

Word or Phrase to Describe this situtation:

- I keep doing tutorials, but I don't know how to make my own project
- It makes sense when I'm inside interactive IDE online program,
  but nothing works when I do it on my own

Tutorial Hell
Avoiding Jumping in Pool

awfulwaffl3: Tutorial Loop of Doom
tinkernthink: Tutorial Purgatory
awfulwaffl3: Tutorial Gluttony
nomorequity: Move to simple projects loop, instead of tutorial loop

I've watched people do these for 6 months
and be like I don't understand how to make anything.

If you want to good at copying tutorials, then copy tutorials

if you are doing a project your chance of succeed greatly increases
if it relates to your job or hobby, and you can actually use it.

What is the point of code.
I read a tutorial, I copy it, I make a TODO app
I then throw the app, and never use it.

..........that is not how programming works, we maintain apps, we improve
we grow them.

It's ok to throw things away, but and always make it useful.

## Refactors

- Continue to Refactor the Command Model
- Refactor and Document more of the project

When you write test data, make it obvious it's fake, and make it obvious
you wrote it. Share your interests, your sense of humor, maybe some facts about
yourself.

- When you see test data, you can pinpoint who its from

## Confessions

I tried Jedi out for like an hour
and was just hating it, probably because I was being lazy
Jedi, COC, YCM comparison

## Story Time

I fell in love
I moved to Portland -> I heard it was land of Ruby
Hit all Meetups
Made Friends
Programmed all day
Found clients

Rails Freelancing
Rails Subcontracting + Whatev JS Framework -> Backbone -> Marionette -> Lil Bit
Angular

Hide from the Frontend

I wanted to all microservices, really into TDD, small Objects.
Eventually found a job in this exact space.

I applied they didn't hire me: They are hired 3 other Jrs
3 months later, the manager, he said do you know angular
I had built a TODO in angular, so the answer was yes

in my first week paired up with the only angular, more a designer
coding the site. And we fought.

backend devs, I wanna,
in my first, I just started doing backend
sat near the backend
Ok fine.
