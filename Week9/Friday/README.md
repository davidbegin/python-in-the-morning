## Improvements

- We consolidated the chat parser code:
  - All commands, should handle command, !command, viewer, @viewer, @Viewer
  - As well as mixed order of arguments
  - Change some output of various commands
- We need a !theme command, takes no name

- Cube Betting Improvements:
  - 2 Modes:
    - Uniq betting, winner take all
    - Split pot

## Bugs

- Saving invalid commands for SFX requests
- paperup command returing wrong message
- look at buying !wyp
- fixing buying non-existent soundeffect
- fix @user for approve

## Refactor

- We MUST Improve the requests interface
- Better logging around when we are saving and deleting from the DB
- STOP having real users, and hitting really "Databases" in tests
- Replacing search with get

## Features

- Wager soundeffects
  - winner take all

- for cool points you should be able to search

- All commands have a fixed health
  - We will start configuring this health

- Total num of soundeffects command

- Add a help for a blank !soundeffect

- Build a robust system for approving soundeffects

- Nostalgia mode
  - Save the songs and money, and can swap them in

- Add Each mode together, for a master mode from throughout the week.

- Record a Video on How Chat Thief Works!
  - Clip???
  - Highlight???

- Quick colorscheme command

- bot man page -> Scremo Band -> Saetia but we only talk about  BSD

## Viewer Questions

haxciting: what is the secret for crystal clear text while streaming?
beginbot: big font???

OBS -> VIM

ogjake: Iâ€™m so split between like wanting to be a front end developer and
wanting to be a back end developer. There is so much to being a front end
developer and everything seems tedious. What do you think begin? @beginbot

Programming is Huge:

- A Frontender could know 0 about backend
- An AI/ML engineer could know nothing about backend
- Generalist or Expert

Programming is a current conversation, so you want
to find things you find interesting to participate long term.

Begin: I don't care about~ browsers and all their updates, keeping up
with that sounds painful.
Begin: I read every release AWS does -> 3 a day

You should think long-term in what excites you.

ogjake: It is very painful. I tried to learn React and it hurts my brain
Begin: don't mix up, being hard, with not wanting to learn it.

Do you know any fulltime react developers?
or React Streamer
Ask: what do they spend 80% of their time in?
or debugging

ogjake: Like idk how to come up with cool programming ideas. Like how did you
come up with this music stuff?
begin: start with dumb ideas, keep building, share with others, get feedback

Listen to Podcasts
Ask people who are deep in the field, what they are excited about right now.

OGJake -> Think Long Term. Programming is a long journey, don't feel rushed,
find things you like, dive deep, bring your head up and explore lots of random
other topics, don't be afraid of looking dumb, have fun!

I've built up wild a Vimrc over years,
Then sshed onto on server to debug something,
been soo frustrating, lacking all keyshortcuts,
that I threw my vimrc out and started .
