## Bugs

- Saving invalid JSON times
  - We could just clear the when it gets corrupted

- You can give anyone props

## Chat Thief

!give sound random

- All commands have a fixed health
  - We will start configuring this health

- Total num of soundeffects command

- Quick colorscheme command

- Add a help for a blank !soundeffect

- Build a robust system for approving soundeffects

- Nostalgia mode
  - Save the songs and money, and can swap them in

- Add Each mode together, for a master mode from throughout the week.

- Record a Video on How Chat Thief Works!
  - Clip???
  - Highlight???

## Refactor

- update new_models to models
  - move all models into

## Future Ideas

- We can simply replay the chat and see where the economy ends up
  - Then we can abstract economic models out, and try out different
    scenario

## Tool I am trying

Aerojump -> <https://github.com/ripxorip/aerojump.nvim>

## Resources

## Bounties

UCB - Upright Citizens Brigrade -> Waiter Skit, what if we lived without
abstraction

## Viewer Questions

artmattdank: what if everytime someone buys a sample the price goes up a little

pinkflufflyllama: is it possible to lock the mouse from leaving a window in i3?

## Questions

## Learnings

## Ponderings

spfar: at work I barely get time for refactoring
beginbot: this has been me,
  -> you have to just include refactoring into the story time
  -> beginbot: I know this isn't always possible

You end taking longer on your stories,
-> everyone else is faster
-> you know the system really well, to debug issues

## Opinions

I am against:
Code Code Code Code
Schedule a Week to refactor

## Debates

## Confessions

## Python Interview

## Business

- Visual Basic Training

## Quotes

> Never too late or too early to start reading the Man Pages - Beginbot
> Why would you watch something, that a studio paid millions of dollars to
make something fake. - Beginbot

## Scraps

## TODO

- Look at the coloring of AG inside of vim

stupac62: @beginbot is there a way to have soundeffect volume higher for us but
lower for you?
detlion1643: @beginbot TODO: Random sound effect given out was a theme song for !nomo_nomad

if you have a help window open you can close it with :helpclose and you don't have to have the help window activated. I mapped it to <leader>hcname
