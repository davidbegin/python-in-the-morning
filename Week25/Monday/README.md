          Is it formal and professional or casual and memey?
- celebrimborfan123: I like how he's trying to make learning programming more fun
- Not sure what I'm getting into

My main concern is it's really selling, but does not explain how
or why its bettter

## Problems with Serverless

- You're psuhed into more and more small Functions,
  this leads to lots of things
    - compounding cold starts

- Serverless at a company
  - We had to raise limits, 5 times

- Nano Architecture, Macro Artifacts
  - Nano <- Smaller than Micro-Services
  - Macro Artifacts <- larger repos, deploying many function

## Stream Goal

- We want to remove the word "switch", when referring to technology.
  We add tools to the toolbox
  We don't "switch" from programming languages.

erikdotdev: I teach k8s a lot. I always tell people there are two distinct skillsets with Kuberentes.

1) Designing for and running applications in k8s <- Best Practices, outside of Kubernetes
2) Operating a Kuberentes cluster <- This will be rarer for Devs in the Future

erikdotdev: I guess there could be a 3rd which wuold be developing custom components

erikdotdev: Kubernetes is great if you have a k8s type problem.
Complex distributed systems with lots of east-to-west traffic.
That's constantly changing.
The type of systems where people were already designing custom distributed systems,
which is how i fell into k8s.
The problem is people are adopting k8s for k8s sake.
Which generally becomes a very bad day. Kubernetes is not a silver bullet with zero-cost.

Kubernetes should feel like bringing order to chaos,
NOT performing some magical spells, that make us able to Scale.
