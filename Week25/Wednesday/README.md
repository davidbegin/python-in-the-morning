## Viewer Questions

alozone: What's the best way to learn these all shortcuts for vim with using the least time as you can for this?
beginbot: Vim or anything is a life long journey, so the key is just learning
the high value shortcuts first.

erikdotdev: I was helping coworkers learn Vim years ago. I used to have a vim command of the week, i'd give everyone lol
erikdotdev: vimtutor, if you like books Practical Vim. Either/both of those will get you started. From there. Pick up one shortcut, abuse it for a couple days to a week till you can't forget it. Find a new one.


Make VIM Journal
  - right everytime you don't know how to something
  - Then pick a day, pick the thing that comes up the most
    research that
  - Keep collecting
  - Prioritize
  - Improve
  - Repeat

## Experiences

- I can tested last night, I don't know by Who:
  - Tried to go to a sleep
     a fly all of sudden appeared, and wouldn't leave me alone
     .... I can't kill a fly <----------
     .....I knew killing the fly would be failing the test
     .....I tried to get over.

     .....Open Windows and see if the flys out.

## Opinions

I don't care about Audio VS Text:
  what matters is:
    - Retention
    - Inspiration
    - Ideas
    - (Comprehension)

Vim Leader Key Options:

## Confessions

## Quotes

zanuss: Samuel 18:27: "David took his men with him and went out and killed two hundred Philistines and brought back their foreskins.

They counted out the full number to the king so that David might become the king's son-in-law.
Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage."
