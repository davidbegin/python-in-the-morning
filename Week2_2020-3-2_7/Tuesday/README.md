Bounties
========

- Vim-plugin to shown when each engine is used

- Stories of the most specific bug:
  - American Somoa Timezone

- Who other than Kleene has more things named aafter them
  in math, science, computers

  - Euler
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_things_named_after_mathematicians

- Make an engine that pareses a regular expression into and english
statement, feed that to say
  - Does it have to be its own regular expression engine

is (?:) only part of PCRE?

Viewer Questions
================
- Building a twitch from scratch or from libraries:
  - Is it for using or for learning:
    - Learning - scratch
    - Using    - using a library

Haze Regex Puzzle
die "invalid format: $code\n" unless $code =~ /x[spq][0-9]+_[0-9a-z]+/;



1. An old, backtracking engine that supports everything.
2. A new, NFA engine that works much faster on some patterns, possibly slower
   on some patterns.



When refactoring the use of regexs:
- Did you change when you choose each engine or force one-engine by default?


What are the context for writing regular expressions:
- Inside you editor
- unixy
- in your programming langauge



Questions
=========
- Whats the difference in the 2 Vim Regex Engines?

- What does grep standfor
globally search a regular expression and print

- Who were regular expressions invented

It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.

- compilers and parsers

- What is Raku
  - Perl 6
  - What is so hot about Raku Rules?
    - What are some patterns or usecases

- Learn about lookaheads
  - Where do exist in the world of regular expressions

- Comparision of POSIX -> Perl -> Raku

Why no just the full syntax of PRCE?
  - Speed, we don't need to do fancy lookaheads and whatnot
    we can speed


```
# BRE
# () are literal
a*(bc)

# () are metacharacters
a*\(bc\)

# ERE
# () are metacharacters
a*(bc)

# () are literal
a*\(bc\)
```


vim - is BRE?
    - is it its own thing
    - is that are patterns are?

However (and this is the fun part), the characters () {} are treated as metacharacters in BRE if they are escaped with a backslash, whereas with ERE, preceding any metacharacter with a backslash causes it to be treated as a literal.

What’s the difference between BRE and ERE? It’s a matter of metacharacters. With BRE, the following metacharacters are recognized: ^ $ . [ ] * All other characters are considered literals. With ERE, the following meta-characters (and their associated functions) are added: 

#### BRE
  - ^ $ . [ ] * 

#### ERE
- ( ) { } ? + |

#### PCRE AKA Perl
- (?:) Non-Capture Group
- Lookaheads introduced in PCRE

2 Top Rexep Implementations:
- Perl
- POSIX

students of Alonzo Church, Kleene, along with Rózsa Péter, Alan Turing, Emil Post, and others, is best known as a founder of the branch of mathematical logic known as recursion theory,


Leader -> Alonzo Church
Students AKA the squad -> Kleene, Turing Peter, Post
Invent -> Recursion Theory


This regex apparently is trash?
(x+x+)+y
The solution is simple.
When nesting repetition operators, make absolutely sure that there is only one way to match the same match.
If repeating the inner loop 4 times and the outer loop 7 times results in the same overall match as repeating the inner loop 6 times and the outer loop 2 times, you can be sure that the regex engine will try all those combinations.

Fear of the Uprade
------------------
- Write dowm what version you are on and what version you area upgrading to
- get the changelog
- upgrade
- take diligent notes on what seems broken, your theories,
  steps you take to fix
- read the changelog
- use google and record the sites you read for information

This ends up being our job as computer programmers working
on legacy systems


Fenyman Technique - Keep learning until you can explain 
it simplfy

    - Vim
  - tools:
    - timing and the syntax
