Today in history: 2020 - 3 - 7
==============================

Richard Merritt Montague died on this date.
Montague wrote on the foundations of logic and set theory,
as would befit a student of Tarski. His Ph.D. dissertation,
titled Contributions to the Axiomatic Foundations of Set Theory,
contained the first proof that all possible axiomatizations
of the standard axiomatic set theory ZFC must contain infinitely many axioms.
In other words, ZFC cannot be finitely axiomatized.
