DougTheCoder: @gouzzz Second is when you are completely stuck and unable to work, find the smallest possible task that will give you a small reward / sense of accomplishment and do it. It's when you are focused on how huge a project is that you become totally blocked.

DougTheCoder: @PinkFlufflyLlama There's no problem a good Regex can't solve LUL :P
