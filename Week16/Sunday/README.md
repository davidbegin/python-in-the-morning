Facebook is worst website of all time.

One of the most important reasons why:
it said oh MySpace, where everyone customize their pages

We are the Darkest Timelime,
And I think the split was at Myspace to Facebook

The rewmoving of users ability to add custom CSS to their
own Page, HAD RADICAL IMPLICATIOHNS.

What is the most pythonista way to split a list in even chunks

pandapersonttv: what does overloading meothd do ?

beginbot: I want this method to act differently than it typically does
          in X context.
          Context -> Subclass
                  -> Instance

fracktalhash: @beginbot ive been following rwxrob and he was teaching how to
make a ./build script could you walk us through yours and explain it abit ?

Begin wanted:

Generate HTML pages and sync them until I'm sick
WHY you may ask,
Because all the techniques and tools to get around this.
I always add my own server right away.
I want to push the HTML to limit, then see what I want life.

How to generate the website:

- bash scripts
- python scripts
- make targets

How did you choose bash VS python VS Make?

python scripts for interacting with my BeginWorld Ecosystem,
we takin commands and users

Bash once we are operating on files

Make - stiching it all together

fish opinions:

- Listen is the syntax better? yes
- Does it look nicer? yes
- Do we like fish?

- Are we sharing scripts?
- Are all our our friends or coworkers?

- If you got a script-trading squad, if yall fish cool

Begin's Switches to Fish:

ohh this is nice
lil script here
lil script there

then I say let me use this deploy pipeline
.....oh wait I have to rewrite it....and all the time
I saved, I have to give it back. No Matter what you have to
write that bash/sh
