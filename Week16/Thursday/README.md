- Reference a asite for CSS

- People to submit personal CCS to customize their page
- The Amount of CSS get, in lines, will be based on something:
  - Street Cred
  - Cool Points
  - Total Soundeffects

In HTML, how do we designate a CSS fallback
Use this file, if not found, use this one.

I want to have at least 10 Raspberry Pis catch on fire
from usage

sana_rinomi: Have users post a paste in link or a raw GitHub file
sana_rinomi: pastebin*
flyboy1565: coding garden has tooling to pull twitch chat to webpage
vaterzz: Video games
ctnight: gaming?

!SOME_SOUND

We save the request
Then another bot, reads the reuqests, and only plays if valid.
Own it, Is it Hated, are you silenced, out of Mana

- Sometimes someone submits a new soundeffect
- calls taht new soundeffect before it's processed
- BUT....by the time their can play, its available.

## Beginworld Finance

People earn CSS
Each person can customize their page, based on number of lines characters
whatsinmyopsec: you should make the css thing accept pastes like github gist raw
hastebin ix.io etc

## Bugs

Both our soundeffect request and submit new soundeffects JSON
got corrupted

We should limit to Full URLs

Certain Audio Files not playing
detlion1643: do you have any other programs besides mplayer to see if the file
is causing issues or it might be something codec wise with mplayer and
licensing?

stupac62: @beginbot something like this: Missing or invalid timestamps.
!soundeffect 0892jfss83 [00:05] [00:08]
stupac62: where brackets is what they replace

Look Sana's soundeffect

-KL0zGd1IwY 00:26 00:31

- Theory: the dash ruins our life
  - convert to full URL
  - Escape properly

Reduce dropeffect,
reduce street output

## Priority

- Keep Working on Beginworld Finance
  - Link for the people
- Fix Bugs

## Cube Rules

- If you guess right on the money you win a cube
- You can only win Once (I have 11 Cubezzz)

- Over 50s you get a mini Cube (2 Mini Cubes)
- 30s - 50s You get a Pretty Nice Cube (6 Regular Cubes)

- Sub 30s you get a Great Cube (2 Great Cubes)

### Ride Or Die Change

If someone changes their Ride or Die,
Then we should generate a Friendship Ended Meme
Using Image Magick

#### HTML For The People

Premature Optimizations:

- I do not want to expose an API
- I do not want to store my data in the Cloud
- I do not want to run a Server

What We Want:

- Generate HTML Pages, linking to other HTML Pages
- Store in S3
- Link to user and command in the URL chat

V1: Build out all the pages, and sync with S3
V2: Only update files when needed

S3 Will Be Our Server
Soon it will make more sense to use a server to pull in data.
However, I would like to go the other route, and do something
simpler than S3. And then brainstorm how we want host Beginworld
on our own Hardware. NGINX?

We are going to host a HTML somewhere: S3

- Automate the start of stream better,
  delete welcome file
  purge various DBs
  backup DBs

- Save cube times, with !cubed

- When an issue you submit is fixed, you should get something
  special bug finder sounds
  What are bug finder sounds

- Expose User information
  - Upload the JSON at regular times, somewhere public.
    S3
    Prices

- beginbotbot
  - 24/7 channel

## Personal Goals

Read Our dependencies before install, just a cursory glance.
Never Watch any new shows again (unless they are real)
It happened.

## Exposing User Data Plan

## Viewer Advice

Does Backend or Frontend Pay More
CS degree or Bootcamp
Which will give me more money.

.....uuh the one you enjoy and do everyday and get better, and its fun.

## Viewer Questions

andrelamus: @beginbot how do you feel about cs research and academic
publication. Serious question
people wanna charge for research papers
Academic system, is a game, not a meritocarcy
Studying, learnign, doing cool things, experimenting, reserching all cool.
Just as long as the GOAL is the Research/Paper in its self.
your goal is to publish, is NOT to perish, not into that.
Don't focus on perish
Auto-telic

In any institution, people ineviditieidtilty start playing the Game.

cachesking: what's your preferred license?

## Stream Visions

## Learnings

## Begin Opinions

## Ponderings

- Nucular Energry -> Steam -> Eletricty

## User Musings

Sometimes when fixing a problem:

- It's best to have you're Users not trigger the problem

If a user COMPLAINS abuot anything, it's not good to ask: IS this user stupid?
It's better to ask, how many other users are THIS stupid (NOT assigning
judgement on the stupidity)

## Experiences

ctnight: @haveyouethan yeah it sounded familiar ctnight: @beginbot speaking of
not being evil, what about using Matrix chat instead of Discord? :D ctnight:
@beginbot they may night be evil it's more about the spirit of owning your own
data and protocols being open and the federation of servers and all that

## Debates

xalorous: Powershell is awesome though. It's object oriented language and
terminal. Enter commands on the command line in sequence or as a one liner, or
write scripts. :beginbotbot!beginbotbot@beginbotbot.tmi.twitch.tv PRIVMSG
xalorous: and my final point about powershell is that you can use it on linux

BeginBot: Too OOP obssesed.....maybe we don't want people thinking OO in the
shell, we thinking files, and pipes and streams

OK cool, SOME NEW exec, has decided that supporting open source is more
profitable. Waht happens when Brad goes to Bank Of America?

New one, WHAT OPEN SOURCE.

## Confessions

I say I "play" the electric guitar, and I don't know even how electricy works

Fish might be better, nicer syntax.
.....however the lack of compability
makes share scripts soo annoying
POSIX
zsh

## Quotes

: My thing reallyt was think of a whacky thing that you want to do in
the future, try to make it. You won't finbish it, but you'll learn from it!
