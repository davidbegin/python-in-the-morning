- People to submit personal CCS to customize their page
- The Amount of CSS get, in lines, will be based on something:
  - Street Cred

  - Total Soundeffects

## Bugs

Both our soundeffect request and submit new soundeffects JSON
got corrupted

We should limit to Full URLs

Certain Audio Files not playing
detlion1643: do you have any other programs besides mplayer to see if the file
is causing issues or it might be something codec wise with mplayer and
licensing?

stupac62: @beginbot something like this: Missing or invalid timestamps.
!soundeffect 0892jfss83 [00:05] [00:08]
stupac62: where brackets is what they replace

- Reduce donate,
- Reduce dropeffect,
- reduce street output

## Priority

- Keep Working on Beginworld Finance
  - Link for the people
- Fix Bugs

## Cube Rules

- If you guess right on the money you win a cube
- You can only win Once (I have 11 Cubezzz)

- Over 50s you get a mini Cube (2 Mini Cubes)
- 30s - 50s You get a Pretty Nice Cube (6 Regular Cubes)

- Sub 30s you get a Great Cube (2 Great Cubes)

### Ride Or Die Change

If someone changes their Ride or Die,
Then we should generate a Friendship Ended Meme
Using Image Magick

#### HTML For The People

Premature Optimizations:

- I do not want to expose an API
- I do not want to store my data in the Cloud
- I do not want to run a Server

What We Want:

- Generate HTML Pages, linking to other HTML Pages
- Store in S3
- Link to user and command in the URL chat

V1: Build out all the pages, and sync with S3
V2: Only update files when needed

S3 Will Be Our Server
Soon it will make more sense to use a server to pull in data.
However, I would like to go the other route, and do something
simpler than S3. And then brainstorm how we want host Beginworld
on our own Hardware. NGINX?

We are going to host a HTML somewhere: S3
