# 2020 - 5 - 6

## Improvements

Silence a User:

- Viewer Vote to Silence
- StreamGod Silence
- Beginbot silence though i3->dmenu->vim

- Slowdown for users

- Bankrupt and remove all sounds of a USer
  -> hook the market to voting, and removing

- save who adds commands, and then, if people hate them, that affects their karma.

- How do we have the market persist

- Work on revolution
- Update sent presentation

Users have Health
if you hate user
they lose health

Stream Gods can revive
I can remove all health
kill
revive

something must persist

refactor all the models
find all places without transactions
we should rap update

## Good News

- Order 4 New Cubes!!!
- Improved Requests interface, need to finish

artmattdank: also begin when you reset the database between each streams, dont
delete the price of the sounds, just cut them in half
