## Viewer Questions

 "choose your source, choose your project..

Minimal Qualifications for a Job:

- No such thing
- you are hired by people
- its all random, and relationships

MVP Junior: (3-6 Months)

    - TODO
    - Chat App
    - Twitter Clone
    - Build a blog
  - Used for personal reasons
- OR contribituted to an opensource project

Things Begin likes about programming for a Living:

- You can wear whatever wacky stuff you want!
- You can have wierd hobbies
- Colored Hair

bobby78906: @beginbot honest answer okay is there an age limit in stem

Any tech Choice:

- Deadlines
- Costs contrainsts
- Team Constraints
- Domain specific issues

Begin:

- 32 -> Starting at 25
- I want to say no
- I want to work talks
- I have also not experienced the age discrimination
- Be yourself, learn what excites you, provide value as it relates to that
  you'll have a job

- When people are starting programming, they are stressed about the path.

Programming path has more forks than resteraunt

There is no set path, your goal is to learn to control your path, or
adjust accorind to feedback.

The Most Imprortant Skill is being able to teach yourself, and
make your own learning path.

Can you code?
Can you solve problems

A Degree does not answer this at all

Programmming is entirely overwhelming

- Program something everyday
- Who cares if you have review stuff hundred times
- Alot learning in programming is more like practice
  - you gotta do the same thing 59 times

promoterstack: If i provided a gitlab repo, and the aws instance, how much would
you charge to build a url shortener with paywall for users, (theoretically).
-> I would cost too much
I have in interviews, asked a canidate, how to build a URL shortening service
50+ times.
SO I Don't want

spfar: Do you have a high end computer just for streaming?

September -> January -> Macbook Pro
I pushed it to the limit
I would crash OBS 7 times
I wanted to get off Mac and get on Linux
Months and months of picking parts, and saved a budget -> $2200

arjunathefeared: why is linux so popular for programmers? never understood that
linux is all the servers
on linux
linux is  open source
open source == free == better than closed source

personal computers -> tiny lil fraction
all the others computers -> big portition

If Linux was a project, it will cost a Trillion dollars

People want to just build,

This for That

and that's not interesting to me
I'm interested in new, new spaces

Uber for Pets
AirandB for Pirates

TTD - Twitch Driven Development

ID -> Unique ID, you can customize

centos1235: is the switch to vim worth it? I'm a full stack JavaScript Dev using
vscode vim currently and have been complimenting making the full change

What does worth it mean?

Vim is fun
Don't be scared
It's a skill a little of (but Vim Mode in VSCode or Evil mode does help)

## Questions

## Learnings

## Ponderings

The faster you get comfortable with smart people disagreeing with you on
everything, the faster you'll learn to programming:
Rock - Paper - Siccsors

Pokemon spirits could be inside
Cue someone saying I'm possesed by Snorlax
Pokemon possed by demons

levinson2504: if u think about it, humans posses pokemons
Pokemon rights criminal unexplored

Is there something natural symbiotic in trainer pokemon relation
and the real problem is the excelleration of Pokemon technology

Bill and Oak are true Villians of pokemon for bringing the technological
enslavemnt of pokemon

Oak is the NSA of the Pokemon world

The universities and ISP want you watching Netflix all day
they want you think it costs money to learn things
and you have to be told what to learn
so they stay in business

Google and Facebook are advertising Companies
The product is you
Google doesn't care about giving the best results

Strong Opinions losely held

## Opinions

bobby78906: hey thanks for answering all my questions. I know there were stupid
questions but thanks. you really a good person

Don't ever worry about asking dumb questions

Our goal is not to NOT ask dumb questions
Our goal is seprate our Ego from our knowledge

2 Developers:

- One doesn't want to seem dumb
- One doesn't care

Begin: Not a good a good person

## Debates

Everyone is stupid about rap music

## Confessions

- I changed my guitar strings, I messed up something, and now the B and E I
  can't bend without buzzing. Guitar technician literate.

## Theories

I think we might have messed our leap days, and we accidently shifted a day.
Sunday -> Monday
This is the real cause Corona
Leap Days
Leaps Seconds

## Spoiled Brat

I deserve more internet
No Netflix
No Hulu
No Disney Plus
Just Programming

## Memories

Object-Orinted in Wikipedia, clicked on other paradigms

## Quotes
