# 2020 - 5 - 6

## Improve the Stream

- Redo Sent Presentation of the Whole Stream
  - Think of Sub Presentations
- Update Docs to be very Clear

- Move the soundeffects setup around

from chat_thief.config.log import error, success, warning

## Emerging Properties of the Market

whatsinmyopsec: people can't afford sounds so they make new ones
biged_twitch: leave it to me to find a bug on my first chat message

!soundeffect

## Improvements

Health for Commands and Users

New Stream God Commands:

```bash
!silence
!revive
```

## Bugs

- Running tests could be breaking the play soundeffect request DB ðŸ˜Ž

beginbotbot shared @disk1of5 already allowed !damn

- Fix attemptming to delete old sounds messages
- improve output of the regular !soundeffect command

## Maybe Fixed

- Adding new Sound Effects is sharing them with all
- None is getting the permissions
  - This was from papering up

## Ideas

Royalties:

If someone explictly buys, shares it, steals it it:
You should get cut,
As the cost goes up you

We don't know who added all the commands:
-> I could parse all the chat logs

Or we could handle it going forward
Or.......
We move to a new system of investments

If you

---

- It should cost something to create new sound
  - If you create a beloved sound, you need to be compensated

- Overriding Bets
- Viewer Vote to Silence
- StreamGod Silence
- Beginbot silence though i3->dmenu->vim
- Slowdown for users
- Bankrupt and remove all sounds of a USer
  -> hook the market to voting, and removing
- save who adds commands, and then, if people hate them, that affects their karma.
- How do we have the market persist
- Work on revolution
- Update sent presentation
- artmattdank: also begin when you reset the database between each streams, dont
  delete the price of the sounds, just cut them in half

## Economic Theories

What makes something a valid currency? Is it just guns??

Sounds are property
Is the introduction of property garenteed to lead us to Evil
OR is man Evil without ownership

Does God want Animal Sacrifices
Doesn't god have everythign
but its the sacrfice

as you trying and add more controls to your economic system (through goverment),
you are inevitably going to restrict the wrong people sometimes
We are inevitably going to push people to new innovative ways to get around our
systems of control

A Black Market will exists, how does the goverment interface with it

How can a goverment correct these situtations
How can the goverement recognize these sitatuons

1 Week:
3 Hour Streams

  -> you get a new chance

There are multiple games going on
Multiple levels
People are all getting something tailored to accomplish something
