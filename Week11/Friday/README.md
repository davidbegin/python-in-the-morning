## Ponderings

X Files -> Major 7th
-> It sounds happy

Hustle Porn
  -> If you are only listening to Gary V, we got a probablem
  -> if you are listened to more Gary, that working on whatever
     you want to, we got a problem.
  -> I need a some help, motivation, boost, oh this nice for a couple weeks
      moving on now!

Anyone with a significant fanbase, has a bunch of idiots in their fanbase
thats numbers

Motivation is Garbage
If you need constant motivation we have a problem

## Opinions

Lots of people think they want to make games

Making games is an entirely different thing than playing games

Gaming Programming Industry == Long hours, low pay, stressful deadlines
because lots of nerds think it'll be a dream job playing videos games all day.

Drag and Drop == Worst thing ever

You want to make games?
Dive in make games

You wanna make money
don't make games

## Debates

Outsourcing -> Its something that happens, goes terrbily often, ends up with
more overall

Outsourcing does not take up work, it creates artifical

Real World:

Begins on a project all alone

Hey you need some help! Lets grab 2 more people (outsourced, to help you out.)

- Begin gets to review that code
- Go back and forth
- Rewrite it

The time of work to completeion is the same, 3 people just got paid.

The fear of not being able to get a a programming job because of outsouring is
ridiculous.
