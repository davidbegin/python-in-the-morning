# Current Week 2020-2-9 - 2020-2-13

## Weekly Goals

- Get our Minimal bot running and cleaned up
- Learn about IRC
- TCP/UDP Lessons
- Get more familiarity with various unix networking tools
  - lsof
  - ss
  - ip
  - netcat
- Learn about the Socket Library

### Begin Streaming Goals

- Learn to write quotes in the correct syntax

### Practical Applications

- Have a PEP and Wikibot
- Have something that grabs out quotes and debates and posts them in chat
- Have a better way to send things to the chat through the power of linux
  - Copy something
  - Hit a command that says send the current result to twitch chat
  - this would probably be calling a script, which would ask for
    the current paste buffer and then would send it to chat
