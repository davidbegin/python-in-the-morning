diogoantonio: how to create a game in Python?
pygame

kidshenck: Is python not a general purpose language? Only good for specific domains?

- What constitutes a domain?
- High-Level versus Low-Level
- We Cross Multiple Domains
warcried: is cmake a DSL lmao
*usuallyhigh:* reveostahw esnes on yletulosba sekam siht

docbibi: I would have said that the "domain" part is read as covering the
problem at hands.
docbibi: And its grammar is only focused on that, not trying to cover everything.
stupac62: Terraform is a DSL
elremingu: unlang is an example for a specific dsl
warcried: is cmake a DSL lmao

MyUsernameFrank: this is an interesting Haskell program:
<http://augustss.blogspot.com/search/label/BASIC> I don't know how it works, but
looks like it creates Haskell code while parsing at compile time, which is then
compiled. The BASIC package: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/BASIC> can
Python do this?

stupac62: Isn't Netscape responsible for JS being everywhere for front end?

gorillatv: So serious question, what made you switch to linux ?
gorillatv: <https://github.com/TjayNL/dotfiles>

- All my servers are linux
- I deploy things in the "Cloud", and it's all Linux, I have developer in docker
  to match environments.
- Docker for Mac Sucks! - You can burn your legs
- Hardware too expensive
- Opensource
- I plan on programming, sitting on a computer, having fun with
tech for the next 300 years, so I want to time learning fundamentals,
how things work, customizing stuff, building my home
- Arch
  - The Meme
  - The Street Cred
  - This is where I thought I would eventually end up
  - So why not just do what the master plan
  - Changed my typing and switched
    - I try to sync hard psychical learning with hard mental
    - New Keyboard Layout + Arch
    - New Language (bonus if a whole new paradigm) + vim
    - Theory: sync not know how to type, with not knowing what to type.

I hear: IT will take too long to learn that!

stupac62: Chat, has anyone used <https://about.riot.im/> ?? Thoughts, if so?

myusernamefrank: I also have an LBRY account, it copies automatically your
Youtube videos, and new uploads, and you get LBC crypto currency if someone
views your videos

## Survey

Whats your vim leader
Whats your tmux leader

docbibi: once a week, end of week, before powering down the computer (once a
week, a proper shutdown)

Do you rewrite you git commits for Open Source PRs

## Questions

- Can you learn to read a language without writing it (programming)

- is Haskell good for Domain Specific languages

- What are the pros and cons of DSL
  - Everything depends
  - Example of Con: VCR
  - Why DSL versus a library

How do we define DSL

Types of DSL:

- Internal
- External

- Why would you want to write BASIC in Haskell?

\ = backslash

/ = frontslash

elremingu: basically dsl is a set of protocols with agreed terminology. can be
everything, an api, a programming language, natural language, a business process

striped slash

## Learnings

DSL = Domain Specific Language

An important and useful distinction I make is between internal and external
DSLs. Internal DSLs are particular ways of using a host language to give the
host language the feel of a particular language. This approach has recently been
popularized by the Ruby community although it's had a long heritage in other
languages - in particular Lisp. Although it's usually easier in low-ceremony
languages like that, you can do effective internal DSLs in more mainstream
languages like Java and C#. Internal DSLs are also referred to as embedded DSLs
or FluentInterfaces

## Ponderings

Glen Gloud

- Other screen -> Nature video -> AQ -> Tmatrix -> Pleasant

## Million Dollar Ideas

BASICCC

hannylicious: we should create a new, more universal slash
360 slash, doubleslash, X

hashslash

( = bendy slash

## Opinions

kidshenck: DSLs are really useful when they're useful, but there's a high bar
they have to reach to be useful.

## Debates

Screen VS TMUX

## Confessions

- I never read BASIC before

## Python Interview

## Quotes

> vivax3794: copy and paste is just a primitive screenshot

## Advice

Don't Screenshot, what could be copy and pasted

Alt: Always screenshot what can be copied and pasted (this way they will learn)

stupac62: @lincolntx google search tip: [programming language] [package/library]
[thing you want to do]

### Totally Lost at Sea Approach

- Take Notes
  - Goal
  - Theory
  - What you tried
  - What you saw
  - What your new theory

I wanna a build a pokemon clone

I want to create a character

## Scraps

## TODO

- More work on beginwiki

I go to make some changes,
I discover problems
cruft
repeated aliases

krystalgamer: my dude you can ditch tmux, if your vim version already supports
"!term"
vim versus neovim
