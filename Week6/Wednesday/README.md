## Sandberg TODO

- Fix the G#, A#, D# Bug
- Start building out an actual test
- Maybe CI

## Bounties

- Write down what you like better
- Separate experience, from Opinion

## Viewer Questions

kiekaemodaiwieco: Whats the recommendation for using map vs list comprehension?

Is list generator non-lazy?

## Questions

- Why the Bitbucket hate?
  - Speed???
  - terrible UI
  - slowslow  UI
  - Bad CI

## Learnings

prefixes and suffixes are both affixes

This would avoid adding a new method, but for different behavior, it's better to have two different methods than one method with a keyword argument that selects the behavior.

## Ponderings

- What if you use a Mac and Linux at home or vice-versa

Beginner Mistakes using Regex:

- Use regex for the wrong job
  - Passing HTML
- Writing their own regex for something suprisingly complicated:
  - email matching regex
  - domain matching regex
  - Instead: What is an accepted vetted regex

## Opinions

docbibi: Honestly Azure is not bad with their "DevOps" solution.  docbibi:
GitLab has some problems for pro. use: you end up on the highest tier if you
want planning features. Which is ridiculous for small companies.

usuallyhigh: I'm kinda glad they're taking over, maybe they can get some more
structure into the whole open source thing

docbibi: At this point I am happy about it too. They are introducing a different approach. I just hope we keep the current state of sane ocmpetition.

Thoughts on Coding Team:

- Interesting having a discord with other people all streaming, with streaming
  problems

- Live Coders - Yuge difference in types of coding people do, levels, goals
  etc.

ssyuni: I don't host on AWS though as it's too expensive for what you get
S3 - Cheap
How are using S3
Are you using intelligent Tiering
Whose you primary firm
s3 as a datalake
CDN -> past the free tier
Hosting a website in s3 -> Cloudfront around it
  -> Put Requests

myusernamefrank: I'm using a VPS from ionos for my website: <https://www.ionos.de/server/vps> starts at EUR 10 per month, and 1 TB traffic included. After this, the speed is throttled to 10 mbit/s, but no extra cost, so basically unlimited traffic
